<p>I’m not necessarily after $200, I’m after a voice. While <a href="https://hackernoon.com/@jare">published on Hackernoon many times</a> and having a <a href="https://github.com/dunncreativess">Github with 100+ repositories</a>, I’d thought it might be a good idea to take part in this competition and get the attention of <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis">https://twitter.com/balajis</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance">https://twitter.com/cz_binance</a> &#8211; maybe even <a href="https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin">https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin</a>.</p>



<h1>Preface: Censorship</h1>



<p>This most recent bit of news time saw YouTube censor many crypto-related voices, and a mail broadcast I received from LBRY mentioned a few (or a lot?) of them ended up there to promote their views and opinions. Moreover, we saw MetaMask removed from the Android Play Store (and also, consequently, my device), purportedly for mining crypto and more likely for offering a competing environment where people can consume the internet than the Play Store itself. This level of censorship creates a world where a few big players (aka. the ultra-rich) can dictate to us what content we can consume where, and leads the way to a dangerous version of the internet where all we can possibly consume is the ultra-rich’s agenda.<br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/1gypbqvU8CjCzicIgUaUFeVLX56b7Te7lREUwnDONBeR9DMGKZo5NmhRbJBZ4ZGP5wvN_Ze4cSy0XxFxZ0LcX5YxynExXuxQOQRXXrBQfrvJb7W-aVqSS6ybJrjbRCUkjmx16S-R" alt=""/></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/4qwxvQORDVRn_oxTr_nuxml1XJZLFwyXCl8daa-l7-PRVzmaE2r4NGU9vv-AT-p6BU_CPQD7EQwsHA7XnOVhs6aWbxa9LZEeDawyXMMVqyPWFT_EvREpnsAOEt2UGl_I_WoxAPKp" alt=""/></figure>



<p>The answer is an open and vibrant decentralized community where censorship plays no part. Minds.com comes to mind, but there has to be other underlying mechanisms to preserve the rights and freedoms of people everywhere &#8211; even in a censorship-free arena, we shouldn’t be subjected to hate speech and other dark web reminiscent dark corners of the internet. This kind of content from supremacists and trolls alike would hurt the overall image and therein hurt adoption &#8211; which would kill our creation before it’s born.<br></p>



<p>SteemIt comes to mind &#8211; along with it’s various interfaces, (and in recent iterations allow an even more well-thought / which allow a) way for people to downvote ‘bad’ content. This is a great solution for the decentralized community to self-moderate it’s own content monstrosity, but by and large this creates a demand for labor that can’t easily be rewarded (cue Steem’s life-long battle trying to figure out how to balance inflationary rewards with the need to self-moderate &#8211; and their nearly Steem-killing problem with people using the reward structure to bribe rewards and over-reward themselves).<br></p>



<h1>Monetization and Reward Mechanisms</h1>



<p>At this point, it’s crucial to remind ourselves that Blockchain is not cryptocurrency. Read that again! The huge interest that the ICO craze pulled into Blockchain was equally as damaging to the image of Blockchain &#8211; if not more &#8211; than the dark web’s dependency on Bitcoin as an anonymous online currency was to the image of Bitcoin. A reward mechanism for users for a decentralized social platform is not required, but could benefit actual users &#8211; actual people &#8211; for their content and social interactions.<br></p>



<p>If there’s a reward mechanism built into a new decentralized social media, it should be one that allows users to reward their favorite users through micropayments and allows the generation of additional rewards through staking an amount of e-currency someone already has &#8211; showing a dedication to the network and allowing the network more buying pressure than selling pressure. Steem does this, but I’m guessing people would want to stake more if there were more perceived reward &#8211; ie. you could earn more from your social presence as a direct result of staking more.&nbsp;<br></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/tawIPlUa64-MNSJ2LPqEAZDmam5AF-HvZ_d_J6iFcNreeFphWd9CzwRG5AkMrSee2i2Op4R0ivoHrBSHYyu_88pT2YUmCX-oJw5io_LRWixstkez3Q74z8XVczk0mv-dE76LEFvk" alt=""/></figure>



<p>If I had a dime for each time I had this conversation &#8211; with some underemployed or unemployed, disenfranchised friend on the internet &#8211; if we had a way to monetize and reward engaging social content we could empower the unbanked worldwide.&nbsp;<br></p>



<h1>Moderation</h1>



<p>&#8212; Note this isn’t the original (or even unoriginal) purposes of this neural evolutionary AI project &#8211; I’m going out on a limb here, without consulting our AI devs on this &#8211; but I think that the given problem would be socially acceptable content, and one could train the proof of fitness to provide that goal. Why not? &#8212;</p>



<p>In projects in the past like Akasha or Mastadon, one key feature that’s perplexed developers is how to monitor and remove spam, plagiarism, hate speech, etc. In a world with increasingly smart AI, there’s no reason to put this labor onto individual users like in Steem &#8211; one could create a neural evolutionary AI that’s rewarded by achieving happier individuals through a ‘report’ mechanism on leftover content. If something’s reported, then that competing generation responsible for that post is hit with a ‘ding’ that keeps it from being the master genome in that set &#8211; and the master genome carries on to start a new generation of competing genomes to do a better job in the next set of posts that are all moderated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The computational power required to run these competing and learning sets of problem-solving algos could be served by p2p nodes that are run by users around the world &#8211; with as little as a laptop, in another chain that rewards the users submitting to the champion net.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi SteemIt! View this post in it&#8217;s <a href="http://dunncreativess.github.io/2019/12/23/benefits-of-neomenia-and-crypto-growth-hacker-compound-your-crypto/">original form on dunncreativess.github.io</a>! View my <a href="https://hackernoon.com/@jare">other posts on Hackernoon.</a> Yes I&#8217;m promoting this post &#8211; I think I have some info you folks might appreciate!</p>



<p>With results among users ranging from 3-4%, and a total net returns for some users at 16-22+% over a few days, it looks as though Neomenia is here to make an improvement in people&#8217;s lives.</p>



<p>Trading on three exchanges simultaneously and hedging risk by altering strategies based on conditions on a given exchange, it looks like Crypto Growth Hacker is the one-stop-shop for crypto investment diversification.</p>



<p>Neomenia now supports trailing takeprofit, meaning the upwards potential of a good buy or sell has increased significantly with your configurable takeprofit. It also has a special feature where the stop size is reduced by the difference in price as a percent when it moves in the right direction, so that you can lock in your profits faster while having a larger stoploss in case sh#t hits the fan.</p>



<p>The win/lose ratio is 5:1&#8230; and <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/chart/XBTUSD/FkIqJJcy-Introducing-Neomenia/">it backtested 10 000% on TradingView</a>.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a price action observed in one spot confirmed in another confirmed again by a direcitonal indicator, and that&#8217;s all I&#8217;m allowed saying under NDA.. but if you want to know more, join the Neomenia chat on Telegram! <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/G3tz4RdZGmNdxs9vXdum7A">https://t.me/joinchat/G3tz4RdZGmNdxs9vXdum7A</a></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/hn110-1-1024x408.png" alt="" class="wp-image-149" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/hn110-1-1024x408.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/12/hn110-1-300x119.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/12/hn110-1-768x306.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/12/hn110-1-1536x611.png 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/12/hn110-1.png 1874w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Crypto Growth Hacker is indexing Bitmex, Deribit and Binance Futures now and using a complex market making strategy on the first two while employing Neomenia on the third. The result is a bot that&#8217;s incredibly resilient and doesn&#8217;t take very many hits that last too too long &#8211; and shows steady gains.</p>

<p>Neomenia is currently running on 8 subscriber&#8217;s accounts, creating predictable yield in sideways or bullish or bearish markets! </p>



<p>The strategy itself is protected under NDA, but as much as I can say it finds price indication in one place confirms it in another then also confirms with directional indication. The result is magic!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/hn2-1-1024x692.png" alt="" class="wp-image-142" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/hn2-1-1024x692.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/12/hn2-1-300x203.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/12/hn2-1-768x519.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/12/hn2-1-120x80.png 120w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/12/hn2-1.png 1224w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>I&#8217;ve created a web interface to launch bots on our own Google Cloud Compute account, taking the hassle and potential issues with configuring your own VPS with bot options straight off your shoulders.. and as it costs us a pretty penny a month, and saves you renting your own VPS, it&#8217;s basically a free VPS giveaway! Woot!</p>



<p>I&#8217;m writing an update predominantly to create FOMO, but the community results speak for themselves&#8230;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/hn3-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-143" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/hn3-1.png 626w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/12/hn3-1-300x124.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 626px) 100vw, 626px" /></figure>



<p>The price of the bot will increase from $49 or $59 (depending if you use our Binance Futures referral code) up to minimum $99 in the new year. The time to come onboard is now! Have no fear, our team and community moderators have your back through thick and thin.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/hn4.png" alt="" class="wp-image-144" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/hn4.png 606w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/12/hn4-300x137.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 606px) 100vw, 606px" /></figure>



<p>So &#8211; come on in, grab it while it&#8217;s cheap!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/hn2-1024x612.png" alt="" class="wp-image-135" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/hn2-1024x612.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/12/hn2-300x179.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/12/hn2-768x459.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/12/hn2.png 1452w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>I&#8217;m offering my market maker bot one of two possible ways: 1. I provide you the source code and you can configure your apikey and secret and review the code to make sure nothing malicious happens, on a profit-share scheme where you provide 40% of the earnings after every month &#8211; as confirmed by API. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/hn3.png" alt="" class="wp-image-136" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/hn3.png 1000w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/12/hn3-300x296.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/12/hn3-768x759.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure>



<p>2. I&#8217;m creating a dividend token for sale to the general public (including Americans) that I then pay monthly 70% of the profit (10% for me, 15% reinvested for compounding effect, 5% BNB holdings). The dividend trading fund would span multiple bots, with an initial spread of 25% Neomenia BTC 25% Neomenia ETH 25% Deribit arb + options BTC 25% Eth. The dividend token script I&#8217;m using doesn&#8217;t have voting, but we&#8217;ll vote on bot % holdings and bot strategies using an off-chain voting system enabled by etherscan reports on holding %, anything more than 5% gets a vote.</p>



<p>The benefits of option 1 is that you get to run one of my bots with a profit-share model, the benefits of option 2 are: a. if you&#8217;re an american citizen you can now kindof take part in leveraged futures trading, by way of the token. b. as our BNB accumulates, we pay less fees c. as our BNB accumulates, we get more % from our referrals d. the combined notional traded on Binance will allow us to further climb their fee ladder. You can also refer people to the crowdfunded bot, for every 100 tokens at $1 worth of Eth apiece minted you get 10 tokens. For every 100 tokens that a referral of your referral mints you get 5 tokens.</p>

<p><a href="https://dunncreativess.github.io/2019/11/24/blog-monetization-on-steemit-com-and-dblog-io/">See this post in it&#8217;s original form on dunncreativess.github.io!</a></p>



<p>Awhile ago I installed Steempress on my WordPress blog on ,/ and Simply Static to export my WordPress site as a static site to local drive and the git commit it to my github.io repository.</p>



<p>Lo and behold, after originally thinking that Steempress wasn&#8217;t working, it appears it is!</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve even included the dblog.io dblog tag, which means they appear here:</p>



<p></p>



<p>The only issue is that I have to replace the images from localhost to dunncreativess.github.io. Small price to pay! If I were to instead host my WordPress somewhere in the cloud (even on a port other than 80/443), it would work.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-40-1024x189.png" alt="" class="wp-image-121" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-40-1024x189.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-40-300x55.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-40-768x142.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-40.png 1256w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Now, $0.06 USD in crypto over 7 posted articles might not sound like much &#8211; but in an adless presentation that solves the monetization-without-bugging-people sense, I&#8217;m now being rewarded by all these people voting on my content instead of a centralized force like Adsense and you&#8217;ll notice that my github.io and my hackernoon don&#8217;t share ads!</p>



<p>It&#8217;s also continuously improving.. that $0.04 is for the lastest article, meaning I&#8217;m gaining momentum.</p>



<p>I mentioned the benefits of DPoS at length to the folks at Hackernoon when they were dreaming up HN 2.0.</p>



<p>Monetization is key. Incentivization is what rules the internet and any publication platform should be centered around ‘how do we turn content into $.’</p>



<p>I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again that we need to consider tokenization and blockchain in order to put the ability to upvote/downvote content (self regulate and moderate) while also allowing shareholders and prolific content producers to have the most influence on the monetary rewards for contributing authors. While Steem appears to be failing because of a misbalance in currencies producing bidbots and scammy 115% returns on promotion budgets, there are alternative sidechains to consider that did away with the SBD concept and pay everything out as VESTed income, so that people are &#8211; in turn &#8211; vested into the success of the platform. Check <a href="http://smoke.io/">smoke.io</a> and <a href="http://whaleshares.io/">whaleshares.io</a>.</p>

<p>I truly believe in DPoS as a technology &#8211; although with a few tweaks it could serve far better than it does on <a href="http://steemit.com/">steemit.com</a>.</p>



<p>When someone shares or upvotes a story, if it then becomes popular and earns a ton of rewards through the social algorithm % of inflation, that person who shared it to get it popular in the first place earns a % of that social % as a curator &#8211; as do all the other curators, weighted by when they expressed interest. This is important for a few reasons. .first, as your most prolific writers along with the team and the stakeholders would be the biggest currency holders, they can do a lot of good by spending time (or automation ways to) upvote posts they like, and get exposure to users or groups of users they think deserve it &#8211; you only get a certain number of upvotes/downvotes per day, which you can increase or decrease by increasing or decreasing the ‘strength’ of your vote (out of 100%). Second &#8211; these large token holders would also be paramount in fighting spam and self-regulating the environment. If there are people drawn to the site with the gleam in their eye of earning crypto by regurgitating content or plagiarizing, these highly vested people can ‘downvote’ said spammy posts and undo any earnings they may have accumulated &#8211; to the point that their post gets a negative up/downvote ratio and can be taken off of web + mobile + whatever UI interfaces to the chain. In short, you gain currency by sharing, creating, or upvoting content… . proportional to your VESTed interest in the platform.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-41-1024x607.png" alt="" class="wp-image-122" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-41-1024x607.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-41-300x178.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-41-768x455.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-41.png 1516w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Moreover, there can be other % uses for the inflation of the currency that can do a lot of good &#8211; one of the integral parts of DPoS is the ‘delegated’ part where there are many nodes hosted by many people, and they can acquire votes from users that are weighted based on how vested they are into the system as a whole. Some of these people (usually the top 21) will earn a % of the inflation pie just for helping produce blocks &#8211; but how they accumulate votes is the important part. They must continually deliver value and hold the network’s priorities at heart in order to outperform those other contenders &#8211; which is good for the network.</p>



<p>Lastly, there can be a ‘team’ or ‘reserve’ % of inflation that can be used to continually fundraise based on the current value of the coin. While everyone is earning via social algos or by being a witness, the team can have a source of continual income with which to spend on the project or improving various aspects to it.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://community.hackernoon.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=6" alt=":slight_smile:"/></figure>



<p><a href="https://community.hackernoon.com/u/david">@David</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://community.hackernoon.com/u/dane">@Dane</a>&nbsp;I know that HN in the past has said one of the advantages to HN 2.0 will be the ability to publish without the hassle of ads… and a DPoS-driven network is one way to ensure that HN will never have to sustain itself by running ads. If the team creates wealth through inflation and the community drives the value of that currency upwards (when really the token came from almost nowhere and represents no legal obligation) it’s basically free money… for everyone&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8211; while empowering those with faith and trust in the new platform to exert more influence by buying more and VESTing more.</p>



<p>It opens a whole lot of other doors, too. How do we add ‘real value’ to that coin? What sorts of services or products can we sell as a group or as the team that aligns the value of the coin to something? Can we create a distributed network of writers that are vouched by community consensus via a new kind of Blockchain reputation system that doesn’t yet exist in Blockchain content networks (aside from their exponential ‘rating’ applied to accounts which can be fabricated if you buy enough attention for your posts), and then pitch this new marketplace of content creators at brands and agencies for exposure and so everyone can win &#8211; while having them pay in the currency, which drives value? Swag stores? Can we set it up so that content creators on the network can hustle out communications to their subscriber list to these brands and agencies? What sort of services can we come up with that are ‘out of the box’ and apply to the hacker community?</p>



<p>I agree wholeheartedly the incentives need to be aligned. I think a good step in the right direction would be to move rewards from liquid to VESTed amounts, which means that those who are looking for a ‘quick buck’ will be less likely to spam up the ecosystem.</p>



<p>I really shouldn’t have said ‘free money,’ and you’re right that it’d have a huge impact on the project and the value of the coin could potentially devour what we’re trying to achieve &#8211; ‘Sure, the upside of a token is very high…but the downside is also very low.’ this is absolutely true!<br></p>

<p>Note: it&#8217;s important to send a res.end in every case, or else your bot will get hung up on old messages it couldn&#8217;t process and no res.end was sent &#8211; putting it in a forever loop of never sending a response!</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-30-1024x130.png" alt="" class="wp-image-101" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-30-1024x130.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-30-300x38.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-30-768x97.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-30.png 1255w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>In the quantitative finance world, there are some holy grails: you can decrease the risk of an exposed position generally by doing something in the opposite direction.</p>



<p>In the simplest form, we can both long and short in two opposite positions on exchanges that use the long-short model like OkEx. In doing so, a price movement up or down will have the exact same effect on your position &#8211; where you&#8217;re losing fees and only fees.</p>



<p>In reality, that&#8217;s no good because we don&#8217;t want to be losing on every trade <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p>What I&#8217;ve decided to try my hand at is something called a &#8216;long straddle.&#8217; This was mentioned during my interview with Coindex Labs a long time ago &#8211; but basically, if you buy a put option and buy a call option &#8216;out of the money&#8217; it&#8217;s relatively cheap &#8211; if the price doesn&#8217;t move at all, they both expire worthless. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-31.png" alt="" class="wp-image-102" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-31.png 741w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-31-300x178.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 741px) 100vw, 741px" /></figure>



<p>But: if the price increases OR decreases a significant amount, one of those options expires in the money.. meaning it gianed value from potentially nothing into potentially something!</p>



<p>What this means is that, while the market maker is performing within specifications and earning money from low price volatility and volumes on the bid/ask, these options can expire worthless and our income from market making pays for the expired options &#8211; and then more!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-32-1024x161.png" alt="" class="wp-image-103" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-32-1024x161.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-32-300x47.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-32-768x121.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-32-1536x241.png 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-32.png 1649w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>If the market moves too much in one direction, we&#8217;re risking liquidating our funds if we hold market making positions that go sour.</p>



<p>If this happens &#8211; one of our long straddle options expires &#8216;in the money&#8217; enough for us to cover our losses. What this means is risk-free trading &#8211; so long as the assumption holds true that the market making earns more than the cost of the options.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-33-1024x108.png" alt="" class="wp-image-104" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-33-1024x108.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-33-300x32.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-33-768x81.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-33.png 1247w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>In my code, we loop through all the expiries and all the strikes for all the options, and then find the one whose ratio of cost vs. profits for a 15% movement in price (which is 100% liquidated at 6.66x leverage) yields the minimum threshold we need to cover $15 000 in exposed futures ($99 900 notional). In our example output, the Dec 6 options straddle for $6250 put and $9750 call would cost a total of 0.017 BTC for both the long put and long call, and each would earn $342 profit if the underlying price moved 15% and all else remained the same. This means that spending 0.54 BTC would completely cover the risk of liquidating 2 BTC exposed at 6.66x leverage &#8211; at least until implied volatilities change significantly or time value declines as we approach expiry! When these situations occur, the hedging bot would just create new orders in real-time to hedge the risk. Hooah!</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://scontent.fyhz1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.15752-9/76702405_2533273790105081_4583222162055233536_n.png?_nc_cat=108&amp;_nc_ohc=4Vbyg5W14HwAQkZ8wLiECu10yKgvGxixDMyWU4xvTgW1tmhU24esQj0Cg&amp;_nc_ht=scontent.fyhz1-1.fna&amp;oh=418a76a2031e74a257d7ae938573091e&amp;oe=5E405713" alt=""/><figcaption><br></figcaption></figure>



<p>Today Coindex Lab&#8217;s CEO had a sitdown with a capital markets guy and then later Two Sigma Ventures &#8211; with the goal of making Coindex a fighting force in quantitative finance.</p>



<p>The good news? Capital markets guy wanted us to start a hedgefund. A random guy from the other coast approached the conversation out of nowhere asking to be connected.</p>



<p>Later, the conversation with TSV yielded &#8216;Good news and bad news:&#8217;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-28.png" alt="" class="wp-image-96" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-28.png 1011w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-28-300x229.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-28-768x587.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1011px) 100vw, 1011px" /></figure>



<p>So we have two &#8211; maybe three! &#8211; pledges for funds when we figure out the legalize of doing so.</p>



<p>The good news for me is that I get both equity share and a cut of the vig (gangster term for the take).</p>



<p>The good news for my readers is that we have the opportunity to get capital into Coindex at ground floor, and start earning on crypto and traditional markets with our patented edge over any given set of market conditions.</p>



<p>You might ask yourself, then ask me, &#8216;but I&#8217;m not a high net worth individual &#8211; how can I contribute to a hedgefund?&#8217;</p>



<p>Well, in keeping with crypto tradition&#8230;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-29.png" alt="" class="wp-image-97" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-29.png 938w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-29-300x137.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-29-768x350.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 938px) 100vw, 938px" /></figure>



<p>We very well might crowdfund in an STO!</p>



<p>While this is still a gleam in the back of my eye and ultimately a rumor &#8211; what this means is that you &#8211; your friends, coworkers, acquaintances, grandma &#8211; can capitalize on <strong><a href="https://hackernoon.com/coindex-labs-novel-search-applied-via-evolutionary-ai-creating-a-money-making-machine-n62j2gei">our value proposition</a></strong>, and learn from my years of experience <a href="https://hackernoon.com/what-ive-learned-from-years-of-arbitrage-and-market-making-975w38rs"><strong>making markets and doing arbitrage trading</strong></a> and <strong><a href="https://hackernoon.com/porting-a-bot-to-binance-futures-market-making-competition-6v6a31qh">derive alphas from our bots</a></strong>!</p>

<p>The above screenshot may not seem like much&#8230; but it&#8217;s the culmination of a genius moment and 11 lines of code (along with one NPM library very slightly rewritten &#8211; replacing the word &#8216;margin&#8217; with &#8216;futures&#8217; in one spot!)</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>pnlusd = -1 * (1 - bal_usd / usd_init) * 100
 if (pnlusd > ((min_withdrawal_perecent * 100) * 2)) {
     var new_usd_init = bal_usd * (1 - (min_withdrawal_perecent));
     binance.mgTransferMarginToMain('USDT', (min_withdrawal_perecent) * bal_usd, (error, response) => {
         if (error) {
             console.log(error)
         } else {
            usd_init = new_usd_init
            initial_bal = usd_init / LB;
        }
    });
}</code></pre>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-21-1024x443.png" alt="" class="wp-image-80" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-21-1024x443.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-21-300x130.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-21-768x332.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-21-1536x664.png 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-21.png 1778w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>When my PNL delta reached 5%, above, my min_withdrawal_perecent variable of 0.025 triggered the code block that withdrew 2.5% of my income from my futures wallet into my exchange wallet. The remaining 2.5% was left inside the futures wallet. </p>



<p>What this means, in actual effect, is that my $5.98 in USDT is now safely in my exchange wallet and the futures bot has no more access to it.</p>



<p>What this means is.. slowly, over time, I&#8217;ll gain back my initial deposit as gains that now cannot be lost unless I risk them again!</p>



<p>What&#8217;s more is that the 2.5% left in the futures account will add to the order sizes, increasing the returns and &#8211; over time &#8211; giving a compounding interest on the returns.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-22.png" alt="" class="wp-image-82" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-22.png 808w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-22-280x300.png 280w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-22-768x822.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 808px) 100vw, 808px" /></figure>



<p>People are thrilled&#8230;</p>



<p>As a note on my previous article, the cost is $59/mo and $10 to affiliates &#8211; AND a $10/mo off if you sign up using our Binance referral link!</p>



<p><a href="https://github.com/DunnCreativeSS/binanceBots/">Check out some of my Binance opensource bots here</a>!</p>



<p>Next Steps?</p>



<p>Stay tuned for our website (maybe on a github.io!) that allows you to pay a month in crypto to sign up for the bot. It&#8217;ll allow you to enter your api key and secret within the browser session, then that same browser session will spwan a google cloud compute instance with those keys &#8211; communicating directly with GCP, without us having any access to those keys! The GCP instance will be spawned with a random SSH key that&#8217;s then thrown away into the abyss of cleared memory! This magic was achieved once before for a bot I&#8217;d created, and I can sure as heck do it again &#8211; and the site will be opensource for auditing purposes. This is better than us asking for keys and leagues better than us giving out our source code, and GCP micro instances are CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP!</p>

<p><a href="https://dunncreativess.github.io/2019/11/17/poc-bot-1-up-31-5-in-5-hours-3-max-drawdown/">View This Post in It&#8217;s Original Form on dunncreativess.github.io</a>!</p>



<p>With nearly 31 BTC notional traded in recent memory, this bot Proof Of Concept even survived last night&#8217;s dump and subsequent pump and ended up 6% ROI after all was said and done. Aweo!</p>



<p>You can <a href="http://patbot1.duckdns.org/">follow the delta graph for this so-far unnamed bot here</a>.</p>



<p>The competing bot with like logic &#8211; less one indicator to confirm &#8211; lost a good 5% ROI during that dump &amp; pump. Less risk = more reward, in this sense!</p>



<p>This bot&#8217;s performance at 20x leverage on Binance Futures is defined by it&#8217;s subroutines, finding price action among an index vs. another index (sorry can&#8217;t divulge more because of NDA) then acting when it&#8217;s doubly confirmed by a volume and a price volatility indicator. For the win!</p>



<p>The best news? This bot&#8217;s creator (who shall remain unnamed for the time being, until he decides to come to light&#8230;) will be charging a monthly subscription fee of $59 USDT &#8211; and $10 USDT of that goes to affiliate referrers, indefinitely!</p>



<p><a href="https://t.me/ManyVolumeSignalMonster">Sign up for our Telegram bot chat room here</a>, to discuss eligibility for coming onboard this bot in it&#8217;s alpha v1.0 form or starting to refer people to it for your own fun &amp; profit!</p>



<p>In more detail, let&#8217;s look at the most recent hour&#8217;s graph of delta on delta&#8230;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-16-1024x393.png" alt="" class="wp-image-71" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-16-1024x393.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-16-300x115.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-16-768x295.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-16-1536x590.png 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-16.png 1827w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Recovering from a 1.5% loss when it entered into a larger position, it&#8217;s slowly climbed from there &#8211; reaching a whopping 31.5% delta and a current +0.617 BTC position.</p>



<p>Running this bot on other balances with other risk factors has been enlightening &#8211; following a liquidation of a small balance at 125x in a dump a few nights ago, the safer bets have been on smaller leverage and smaller order sizes.</p>
