<p><a href="http://jare.cloud/2020/01/22/building-an-ai-everything-you-need-to-know-about-artificial-intelligence/">View this post in it&#8217;s original form on jare.cloud</a>!</p>



<p>With <a href="https://thenextweb.com/artificial-intelligence/2020/01/20/sundar-pichai-offers-a-cryptic-warning-against-over-regulating-ai/">Google&#8217;s execs offering warnings on regulating AIs</a> and thinktanks predicting artificial intelligence will take over all sectors of labor, and <a href="https://searchhrsoftware.techtarget.com/news/252477189/Impact-of-AI-on-jobs-goes-on-the-presidential-campaign-trail">AI stealing jobs having an effect on the campaign trail</a> &#8211; it&#8217;s as important as ever to know everything you need to know about artificial intelligence.</p>



<p>What are the pitfalls of AI? What are they really well suited at doing? How do they work?</p>



<p>AI &#8211; traditionally &#8211; take a bunch of data (a training set) and figure out ways to approach problems by being rewarded or reprimanded points, which affects the fitness of a model. By telling the AI what we want, we can achieve the results we&#8217;re after. It&#8217;s then applied to new, raw data, with the idea that it can predict an outcome or achieve an objective.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2018/10/ai_virtual-monitor_circuitry_binary_robot_robotic-100777427-large.jpg" alt="Image result for ai"/></figure>



<p>Artificial Intelligence &#8216;learns&#8217; better ways to approach a problem, and modifies its approach to do it better. It&#8217;s naturally suited to things like recognizing faces in images or <a href="https://jare.cloud/2020/01/22/how-to-build-a-winning-tool-for-sentiment-analysis-of-twitter-data/">identifying emotions or sentiment in text &#8211; even if it&#8217;s expressed sarcastically</a>.</p>



<p>When does it fail? AI can be trained on too large of a dataset or with too many rewards/detriments, which is called &#8216;overfitting&#8217; the model. This would mean that the programming becomes too familiar with the older data, which looks better on paper but in reality causes it to be less accurate when it&#8217;s thrown to the wolves with new, live data &#8211; and it performs worse than a less &#8216;fitted&#8217; model might have. Boo!</p>



<p>As Chief Liquidity Officer for Coindex Labs, we&#8217;re employing a new and novel approach to AI that is naturally resilient against overfitting. <a href="https://jare.cloud/2019/11/07/we-used-evolutionary-ai-and-novel-search-to-build-a-money-making-machine/">This is a neuro-evolutionary  AI</a> &#8211; meaning that it not only learns on a training set based on +1/-1, it also has competing datasets in a generation that see who can perform better &#8211; and they pass down certain genetic traits when they&#8217;re successful to the next generation&#8217;s population, for them to compete again. We&#8217;re first applying it to new &amp; novel markets for trading financial assets, then transferring those lessons to more traditional markets, and finally going to use the research to solve basic human needs.</p>



<p>What does this mean for you? While artificial intelligences become smarter and achieve more and more objectives, they&#8217;ll be able to replace human labor in more and more sectors. While this might not necessarily put you out of the job any time soon, you should certainly ensure that your kids know enough code to be dangerous in a New World Economy where the wage earners are those teaching the AIs to do things that &#8211; in the 2010s &#8211; millions of wage earners used to accomplish. Case in point is self-serve checkouts &#8211; or even in the generation before, Automatic Teller Machines. <a href="https://newsexaminer.net/food/mcdonalds-to-open-restaurant-run-by-robots/">There are even whole McDonalds restaurants without any human staff</a>!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://newsexaminer.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/McRobot-810x553.jpg" alt="New McDonaldâ€™s In Phoenix Run Entirely By Robots"/></figure>



<p>To stay ahead of the curve, you can encourage kids to take part in logic, code and maths. While this might not seem exciting, the right programs will focus a kid&#8217;s attention on the fun that can be had with code: I was introduced to C++ in the 90s and immediately started to build an RPG for my friends and I to play. This is the kind of introduction, positioning and framing that allow kids to associate their favorite activities with this new &#8211; and life-long &#8211; challenge.</p>



<p>With all change and even change that negatively affects many comes new and interesting opportunities. The advances in AI and associated new and novel tech like augmented reality, virtual reality, and whole ecosystems popping up surrounding the artistic need for these communities, products and services will never be able to be fully replaced by the machine. Someone in the future will be able to completely provide for themselves and their families by creating fun artistic pieces that manifest in a digital world. Indeed, people already are!</p>

		<title>Top 3 Ways: How to Influence People and Make Friends (and How Maslow Theory Applies)</title>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><a href="/2020/01/22/top-3-ways-how-to-influence-people-and-make-friends-and-how-maslow-theory-applies/">Read this post in it&#8217;s original form on jare.cloud</a>!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/1-27.png" alt="" class="wp-image-422" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/1-27.png 700w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/1-27-300x171.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></figure>



<p>Do you need motivation? Learn how to influence people and make friends with this quick cheat-sheet, straight from the mind of someone who&#8217;s almost a narcissist! </p>



<p>No, wait, before you click off thinking &#8216;yeah yeah edgelord&#8217; consider this: the people who know most about how to manipulate people are those with Cluster B Personality disorders &#8211; like narcissism or, in my case, anti-social personality disorder. You can <a href="https://jare.cloud/2020/01/15/why-schizophrenia-is-the-most-under-represented-of-all-the-death-sentences/">read more about my various diagnoses here</a>, and how I&#8217;ve managed to overcome most of the disadvantages of having the mind of a maniac.</p>



<p>Regardless of how you look at it, the act of influencing is indeed a form of manipulation. Your goal is to drive a result, and that result is making friends &#8211; and your means are all positive, helpful, and adding value. There&#8217;s nothing nefarious going on here, just a silly &#8216;bad word!&#8217;</p>



<h2>1. Anticipate Their Needs</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.investorincustomers.com/images/blog/cf873c91edf95f87026e60b7b73f5c9e__033c/zoom334x304z50000cw668.jpg?etag=2ba284b2f6a6ae13a7bdfd7270ab49ad" alt="Image result for anticipate needs"/></figure>



<p>Maslow&#8217;s hierarchy of needs teaches us that people require certain things in a certain order in order to achieve fulfillment or happiness. People worried about being bombed usually aren&#8217;t focusing on reaching their inner potential with the cello. If you can get a grasp on the evolution of someone&#8217;s needs, you can help them achieve these goals &#8211; and together, you&#8217;ll conquer more barriers faster. They&#8217;ll be grateful.</p>



<p>What is Maslow&#8217;s hierarchy? <a href="https://jare.cloud/2020/01/21/maslovs-hierarchy-of-needs-universally-applied-for-1st-world-countries-anyways-heres-a-wellness-pyramid/">Click here to read my other article on happiness pyramids</a>, and how they apply more generally and in first-world populations. In reality, everyone&#8217;s Maslow hierarchy of needs is individual and their own experiences, desires and barriers apply.</p>



<p>For instance, at school or work there might be subjects where you&#8217;re stronger, and the person or people you&#8217;re looking to influence might be lacking. In this kind of situation, you can lend your know-how in small and maybe even subliminal ways &#8211; if you lend a hand, chances are it&#8217;ll gain you some affection.</p>



<h2>2. Create Opportunities to Share Time</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://inspiringtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/couple-spending-quality-time.jpg" alt="couple spending quality time"/></figure>



<p>This one is a no-brainer. A long time ago a friend was giving me her opinion of winning the affection of someone of her same sex, and recommended that I maximize the amount of time I&#8217;m around that person. The theory was if I was there more often, and able to talk and listen more often, then that person would become more attached to me and I would eventually become someone of more value to them. It was true! </p>



<p>Following Maslow, we could find or anticipate the activities these people or this person likes to or may like to partake in. We can recommend they join us &#8211; whether it be groceries or some other basic human need, or something higher on the happiness pyramid like chess club. Be creative! Everyone&#8217;s heard &#8216;want to join me for a coffee?&#8217; but not many people hear &#8216;let&#8217;s go ziplining!&#8217; that often.</p>



<p>The internet is awash with ideas on how we can <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-e-g-most-efficient-way-to-spend-time-with-someone-with-the-aim-of-deepening-a-friendship-or-relationship">spend more time with people to deepen friendships</a>, or to <a href="https://inspiringtips.com/ways-to-spend-quality-time-with-your-partner/">spend more time with our partners</a>. As with anything else on the internet: take what you read with a grain of salt, and apply your own reasoning and logic on the tips and tricks you read. It&#8217;s your life, remember! </p>



<h2>3. Listen More, Speak Less</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.slickwords.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/they-listen-more-when-you-speak-less-63059.png" alt="Image result for listen more speak less"/></figure>



<p>This piece of advice is helpful across segments of anyone&#8217;s life. It seems that a generational problem we&#8217;re facing is that people will often listen enough to form an opinion and then &#8211; as if they like to hear their own voice &#8211; will interrupt, speak up and move the conversation off the original speaker&#8217;s point. Try to avoid this! According to Maslow theory, we can identify which of their tiers of needs are being met and what their more critical problems are. Someone trying to find housing is more concerned about meeting that basic need than they are about finding a partner. Focus on the problems that resonate with the person, and actively listen &#8211; find the points and passion in their story &#8211; and think before you respond!</p>



<p>Interested in how people with psychoses think? You can read a creative <a href="https://jare.cloud/2020/01/14/how-do-people-with-mental-health-illnesses-like-schizophrenia-or-other-psychoses-think/">piece about symptomatic thoughts</a> I authored here!</p>

		<title>How to Build a Winning Tool for Sentiment Analysis of Twitter Data</title>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><a href="http://jare.cloud/2020/01/22/how-to-build-a-winning-tool-for-sentiment-analysis-of-twitter-data/">See this post in it&#8217;s original form on jare.cloud</a>!</p>



<p>Today, we&#8217;ll summarize my continued efforts to build a sentiment analysis tool. This tool is using the Twitter API to consume 97 different Twitter handles, that provide Crypto trading signals. This method can easily be applied to traditional markets &#8211; effectively capitalizing on new and highly lucrative means for trading stocks online. We&#8217;ll be reviewing the opportunities to add a neuro evolutionary AI to our bot. You can review the <a href="https://jare.cloud/2020/01/15/automated-crypto-trading-bot-to-buy-pump-and-dump-sentiment-signals-from-twitter/">first iteration of this series on Twitter sentiment bots here</a> on my blog.</p>



<p>When it comes to classical issues facing sentiment analysis applications, it&#8217;s important to consider how algorithms work. If we&#8217;re using a Natural Language Processing tool to rank the individual words in a phrase based on positive, neutral and negative sentiment, wouldn&#8217;t a product review like &#8216;All these wonderful new features! Although none of them work!&#8217; confuse the machine? Words like &#8216;none&#8217; are the true sentiment &#8211; being negative &#8211; but the overall feeling the programming gets from the message involve words like &#8216;wonderful&#8217; &#8216;new&#8217; &#8216;work.&#8217; This would yield a false positive in the ranking and scoring of phrases. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/1-14-1024x329.png" alt="" class="wp-image-370" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/1-14-1024x329.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/1-14-300x96.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/1-14-768x247.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/1-14.png 1110w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>What we need is a way for the computer to overcome this sarcasm in the tweets. Certain <a href="https://medium.com/dair-ai/detecting-sarcasm-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks-4a0657f79e80">AIs are capable of establishing context</a> by ranking sentiment, emotion and personality. We&#8217;ll then apply this when we analyze Twitter data. As <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jarettdunn/">Chief Liquidity Officer of Coindex Labs</a>, I have access to a new and novel way to train datasets and apply resulting genomes on configurations &#8211; using an AI that&#8217;s naturally resilient to over-fitting.</p>



<p> AI has other advantages when it comes to sentiment analysis, like identifying unique opinions that may otherwise get re-hashed, re-worded, and delivered in a separate &#8216;original content&#8217; tweet. This doesn&#8217;t really apply as much in our trading bot, as we&#8217;re limiting our input tweets to those 97 Twitter accounts, but with a larger dataset this is critical. To identify the true emotion of the Internet at large, we&#8217;d need a way to filter out people (and even computers) with accounts that are used to artificially manipulate people&#8217;s sentiment bots. It&#8217;s &#8216;a feint within a feint within a feint,&#8217; as Muad&#8217;Dib would have said!</p>



<p>Once we&#8217;ve created our new model and use it to weed out the bad apples, our analysis of sentiment will be far more effective. As far as sentiment scores go, this tweet that my Twitter bot picks up on is ahead of the bell curve &#8211; but, on manual inspection, it looks as though it&#8217;s a joke rather than actual sentiment one way or another.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-58.png" alt="" class="wp-image-369" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-58.png 815w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-58-300x99.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-58-768x253.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 815px) 100vw, 815px" /></figure>



<p>Entries like these should be ignored in the final product. I&#8217;ve toyed with the idea of human intervention before acting on a given signal, but the delays involved would mean that the average trader would miss 70% of the swing. Ideally, the bot would act on the &#8216;good&#8217; signals within a matter of seconds or minutes &#8211; beating the overall shift in the markets when others pick up on the sentiment, before everyone exits. This is how the goldmoney is made.</p>



<p>This is what a profitable tweet looks like, and currently our win/lose ratio is far higher than 50% &#8211; combined with a creative trailing takeprofit, we can establish an edge on the market:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-59-1024x190.png" alt="" class="wp-image-372" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-59-1024x190.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-59-300x56.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-59-768x143.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-59.png 1361w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/666371834102677565/667705444596187136/SmartSelect_20200117-122805_TabTrader.jpg?width=367&amp;height=658" alt=""/></figure>



<p>The next steps are to build out the AI&#8217;s training set with loads of tweets to run analysis on. These will then serve as a benchmark with which to apply to forward-testing data with live, real incoming tweets based on our followed list. Then, our evolutionary part of the neuro evolutionary AI will create competing sets of genomes with the different input variables, and the best-performing genome will become the champion set that runs the live trader. The next generation of genomes will then (likely, by and large) perform better vs the previous generation, and a new champion might be selected. </p>

All in all, we have a clear plan for how our analysis of Twitter for fun &amp; profit will continue to become more sophisticated and the win/lose ratio will increase significantly. </p>

<p><a href="http://jare.cloud/2020/01/21/maslovs-hierarchy-of-needs-universally-applied-for-1st-world-countries-anyways-heres-a-wellness-pyramid/">View this post in it&#8217;s original form, on jare.cloud</a>!</p>



<p>In a given Maslow&#8217;s Hierarchy of Needs you&#8217;ll find a tiered pyramid that starts with you being fed, and climbs  thru safety then belongingness and love, esteem, and finally &#8211; at the highest tier &#8211; self-actualization.</p>



<p>A brief search on your favorite search engine will find images like so:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/maslow-5.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-358" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/maslow-5.jpg 900w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/maslow-5-300x223.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/maslow-5-768x572.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></figure>



<p>What I&#8217;d like to suggest is a Maslow Hierarchy for people in first-world countries: where we take safety for granted. What do we need in our Wellness Pyramid in order to be, well, well?</p>



<p>On our first tier, we&#8217;ll find rest and liquids. Any doctor worth his weight in gold (or bitcoin) will tell you that the tricks to becoming well are rest and liquids. Without sleep, we&#8217;d eventually turn insane and then die &#8211; and without water, we&#8217;d die within days. Days! Interested in bitcoin? <a href="https://jare.cloud/2020/01/15/better-web-brave-rewards-your-content-make-money-monetizing-twitter/">Read here how you can turn your daily browsing into potentially hundreds of dollars a month</a> &#8211; as advertisers pay YOU for viewing your ads, all the while blocking dangerous 3rd-party ads (like YouTube ads).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-54.png" alt="" class="wp-image-359" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-54.png 981w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-54-300x210.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-54-768x537.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 981px) 100vw, 981px" /></figure>



<p>Stay hydrated!</p>



<p>On our next tier we&#8217;ll find the other stuff that medical professionals recommend for anyone, regardless of their physical or mental ailment (barring extremes, like catatonic schizophrenia): Exercise, and healthy diet!</p>



<p>We can control a whole bunch of our brains worst and best tendencies if we practice these two essential parts of our lifestyles. <a href="https://thesleepdoctor.com/2017/05/22/benefits-exercise-sleep/">With proper and regular exercise we not only sleep better</a>, but we feel better and we live longer. Fact! With healthy diet we can make sure that we keep our body&#8217;s needs in check and also feed our brains the vitamins, minerals and all that jazz that it sorely needs in order to think better, <a href="https://www.theemotionmachine.com/how-to-use-diet-to-impact-positive-thinking/">think more positively</a> and think more often.</p>

<p>Now, to be well we need to be stress-free. The #1 way to be stress-free is to distract yourself: like <a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/the-importance-of-hobbies-for-stress-relief-3144574">to spend time with hobbies reduces stress</a>, jobs, a gamenight with family or the internet&#8217;s world of memes and joy can all help you spend the time. These distractions give you little doses of dopamine throughout the day that you can expect and count on. Down this road also lies dangerous, negative solutions like drugs and alcohol giving you that same release &#8211; so take care, and try to surround yourself with activities that attribute to your overall success rather than detract from them. </p>

<p>What crowns our new wellness and happiness pyramid? </p>



<p>Fulfillment.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re all trying to be heard, to be cared about and to have an effect on someone&#8217;s life, way of thinking, or their own wellbeing &#8211; whether they be close to us, or the greater population at large. Some of us take up blogging &#8211; some of us, journalism &#8211; and some of us just want to make sure we have some kind of everlasting imprint on our kids, friends or other loved ones.</p>



<p>This is quintessential to your wellbeing and health when all else is taken for granted.</p>



<p>As you grow older, you may notice that your mobility and autonomy start slipping away. You&#8217;ll no longer be able to drive, to garden, to sing &#8211; and you may find yourself less and less responsible for other people&#8217;s schedules, days, and otherwise find yourself proving less and less of a use.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re young now: enjoy your autonomy and mobility. Enjoy the ways in which you influence others and win friends.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re getting older: try and find new and exciting ways to have an effect on the world (like blogging, writing a book, or otherwise expressing yourself in a low-effort way. Did you know you could speak to your internet browser, and have it type out what you&#8217;re saying? It&#8217;s called Speech-to-Text!). </p>



<p>Are you interested in blogging, or are you already blogging, but want to feel a little bit extra dopamine when you&#8217;re expressing yourself? <a href="https://jare.cloud/2020/01/20/publish0x-allowing-rewards-for-content-with-their-own-funds-re-distribution-of-wealth-defined/">Sign up for Publish0x as an author and get rewarded by people tipping you</a> &#8211; the tips come from their own funds, and the tipper earns a custom % of the tip, too, so everyone wins!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-57.png" alt="" class="wp-image-362" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-57.png 986w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-57-300x212.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-57-768x543.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 986px) 100vw, 986px" /></figure>



<p>And that concludes our Wellness Pyramid, a Maslow Hierarchy applied to everyone living where the basics are taken for granted!</p>

<p>New to BAT and Brave? Here&#8217;s an article I wrote describing the Brave ecosystem&#8217;s value proposition &#8211; <a href="https://jare.cloud/2020/01/15/better-web-brave-rewards-your-content-make-money-monetizing-twitter/">how you can earn money by browsing with a safer, more private browser</a>!</p>



<p>As highlighted in the above article, some users in the US are earning as much as $107 USD / month / browser for their BAT-enabled Brave browser. </p>



<p>This led me to DuckDuckGo some prices for low-tier Chromebooks and Android devices:</p>



<p> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BATProject/comments/er653q/has_anyone_thought_about_brave_hardware/">https://www.reddit.com/r/BATProject/comments/er653q/has_anyone_thought_about_brave_hardware/</a>  </p>



<h1>Has anyone thought about Brave hardware?</h1>



<p>I think a Chromebook series running Brave&#8217;s Chromium wouldn&#8217;t be too difficult to create &#8211; legalities aside, all you need to do is enable dev mode and replace the browser, or boot it into a Linux crouton build with Brave as the default browser in a Linux build&#8230; with DDG as default search, to boot&#8230; if you figure in Brave Rewards over a year (or 5yr) the price of a given chromebook line becomes almost negligible, or 0.</p>



<p>Wouldn&#8217;t businesses die over the opportunity for 0-cost or revenue-generating hardware?<strong> </strong></p>



<p>$155.99 CAD Chromebooks galore:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.shopbot.ca/m/portable-devices-laptops?q=chromebook&amp;sort=price" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">https://www.shopbot.ca/m/portable-devices-laptops?q=chromebook&amp;sort=price</a></p>



<p>My 3-day BAT earnings: 0.24 USD, 0.314 CAD</p>



<p>1-day average: 0.1046 CAD<br>365 days/yr: $38.21<br>Break-even: 4.08 yr</p>



<p>&#8230;. that&#8217;s infinite money to these people that underwrite machines&#8230;</p>



<p>The community had some thoughts about a link between Eich and KaiOS, and even linked to a method for <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/eqkx5g/lxde_summer_is_coming_d/">removing Chrome from Chromebooks</a>.</p>



<p>What I think this allows the tech-savvy entrepreneur to do is a few things:</p>



<ol><li>You can buy a line of Chromebooks at a discount price<br>For as cheap as $156, and even cheaper in bulk, Chromebooks are the most interesting subject for this idea as all of their activity happens within the browser inside the device. There are no desktop apps.</li><li>Set their browser to use Brave Chromium<br>This is fairly technical, but someone can replace the browser on Chromebook with Brave-flavored Chromium.</li><li>Resell these laptops to any person that uses the internet<br>The logic is in the money&#8230;</li><li>Along with their new, lightweight and cost-effective machine is the Brave Browser<br>It&#8217;s faster, more private, and more secure!</li><li>Which will earn them BAT for viewing ads as Brave Rewards<br>Within the first day, the investment will start paying itself off&#8230;.</li><li>And so, over time, their investment in the hardware goes down<br>Each month there&#8217;s a new Brave Rewards payment that &#8211; if you apply it to the cost of acquisition &#8211; lowers the barrier to entry for computing!</li><li>If the case is true of certain geos earning >$100 per month in BAT, then the ROI for your new machine is &lt;2 months<br>If I told you you could have a new computer every 2 months, wouldn&#8217;t you be interested? Wouldn&#8217;t you become a return customer??</li><li>In the case of larger organizations that require many dozens, hundreds of machines, they can get a loan for a working web browsing device (or even larger, heftier Windows-based machines) and after a few months start earning income on top of the cost of the machine<br>This is where the big money is. If an organization can acquire net-free pr net-earning hardware in their regular line of business, that would have otherwise been a cost, wouldn&#8217;t they be inclined to?</li><li>This allows a huge advancement in the way people look at equipment financing<br>Net-free or net-revenue generating equipment = $$$.</li><li>Which, in turn, helps the adoption of BAT and Brave<br>More users, more ads, more creators and publishers!</li></ol>



<p>The real questions are how do we create a version of Brave that allows a small- medium-sized organization limit the use of the Chromium browser, ie. block certain sites &#8211; or those other than a whitelist? I&#8217;m sure they can achieve this effect on the network level, though! Also, how do we create institutional-level Brave rewards accounts, so that the individual user on the individual browser isn&#8217;t able to redeem or move around Brave tokens &#8211; rather, they&#8217;re sent to one larger chest?</p>

<h1>Microtipping: Future of Social Rewards?</h1>



<p>With a minimum BAT tip of 1 BAT, there&#8217;s been some discussion around the interwebs of instituting a custom # BAT tip.</p>



<p>This would allow, as one user mentioned, the ability to microtip a fraction of a BAT at the same time they save a tweet for later &#8211; which would benefit everyone. Whereas, at present, a whole BAT might not be sustainable for each time I&#8217;d want to share some love &#8211; a fraction of a BAT would.</p>



<p>With Uphold as the present custodial license for holding and transferring BAT and BAT rewards around the Brave ecosystem, does this work super easily &#8211; comparing it to microtipping BAT on the Ether blockchain? Is Uphold off-chain, allowing any number of smaller transactions? Would future custodial solutions that aren&#8217;t requiring KYC allowing us to also microtip in this fashion?</p>



<p>Microtipping (along with the ease of use of the Tip function on social sites that Brave allows) would restructure the way people use (and think about) social interaction online.</p>

<h1>Example of Driving BAT and Crypto Adoption thru Responding to LinkedIn Promotion (since removed by mods)</h1>



<p>Preface: Lisa was an outstanding connection request on LinkedIn I confirmed maybe 24 hrs ago. She has 10 mutual connections, and 500+ total.</p>



<ul><li>Hi, I am Lisa, Web Development Manager and I work with experienced IT professionals who are into: * Create a New Website * Redesign a website? * Website Design and Development * Update Your Existing Website * E-Commerce Solutions If you are interested, then I can send you our Price list, company information and an affordable quotation with the best offer. Sincerely, Lisa</li><li><strong>TODAY</strong>&nbsp;1:33 AM</li><li>We are really looking forward to receiving your answer so that we can get to any final conclusion Best Lisa<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f4f7.png" alt="ðŸ“·" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li><li>Jarett Dunn 12:30 PM</li><li>Hey, no thanks!</li><li><strong>Jarett Dunn</strong>&nbsp;12:34 PM</li><li>To drive revenues, you should let your website proprietors know above Brave browser and BAT:&nbsp;<a href="https://jare.cloud/2020/01/15/better-web-brave-rewards-your-content-make-money-monetizing-twitter" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><strong>https://jare.cloud/2020/01/15/better-web-brave-rewards-your-content-make-money-monetizing-twitter</strong></a>/ Since verifying myself as a Brave publisher a/o 4 days ago I&#8217;ve earned ~11 BAT ($2.20 USD) in donations to my different platforms. That might not seem like much, but for someone with a larger audience or following it can serve as an additional revenue stream. This is compared to my&nbsp;<a href="http://medium.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><strong>Medium.com</strong></a>&nbsp;earnings for the last ~12 days, at $1.80 USD.&nbsp; As a Brave affiliate you can also earn up to $7.50 USD for browser installations that remain installed after 30 days. Since putting up that Brave article that I linked you to, I have 7 downloads and 4 installs &#8211; this could yield up to $30 USD in affiliate income, over 4 days of referrals so far.</li></ul>

<p>Comment: I agree withÂ <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.reddit.com/u/O1O1O1O/" target="_blank">u/O1O1O1O</a>Â &#8211; because Brave rewards users with advertiser&#8217;s funds to then pay (or not..) their favorite content producers, then every user eventually has a BAT or a few to redistribute &#8211; and everyone wins. Brave also allows content creators/publishers of many times &#8211; theoretically any platform that includes an API where we can decide if one user&#8217;s view on a profile is for a specific other user. This discounts sites like Facebook, Minds, but is already beautifully connected on Twitter and here on Reddit. This is potentially far more views, far more publishers and far more ad spend than Medium.<br></p>

<p>In the next iteration of my 1st party ad service, I created Javascript code that randomly chooses one of two ads to display in the header of each of the pages on my blog. This Brave-friendly ad displays content about Brave or Publish0x. It also detects mobile displays and gives a smaller banner for mobile.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s genius in it&#8217;s simplicity. . . I half want to re-package this into a WordPress plugin for other Brave content creators on WP.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s some code:</p>

<p>Interested in a way to utilize Crypto Pump n Dump tweets &#8211; for fun &amp; profit? <a href="https://jare.cloud/2020/01/15/automated-crypto-trading-bot-to-buy-pump-and-dump-sentiment-signals-from-twitter/">Check out this article I wrote on making mad stacks on Twitter sentiment</a>!</p>



<h2>Day 1</h2>



<p>I had a thought: if some of my traffic comes from Twitter to Medium and my blog, wouldn&#8217;t I want to maximize this &#8211; in a hands-free fashion? I&#8217;ve done this before &#8211; some of my accounts had 5k+ followers in a few months. I had bought a Google sheets templated sheet doc with Twitter integrations, and bam it flew. I later created a Github repo for a hackathon starter fork where I put in all these juicey follow, retweet, favorite logics into a prettier UI.</p>



<p>The benefit of the hackathon starter is that I can login via oauth &#8211; meaning the app has api keys, but the user does not. We&#8217;re all used to oauth login &#8211; do you want to login using gmail/facebook/twitter? Redirect to platform, redirect to site, success!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-21.png" alt="" class="wp-image-236" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-21.png 876w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-21-300x245.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-21-768x627.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 876px) 100vw, 876px" /></figure>



<p>I resurrected my gsheet today and started the magic. I made some edits to the code: specifically we want to follow, retweet and favorite. Hooah!</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s set our benchmark&#8230;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-20-1024x303.png" alt="" class="wp-image-235" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-20-1024x303.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-20-300x89.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-20-768x227.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-20.png 1032w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2>Day 2</h2>



<p>Well, we have some initial results! Twitter app on my phone has been blowing up. Let&#8217;s analyze the results so far&#8230;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-22.png" alt="" class="wp-image-237" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-22.png 1009w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-22-300x98.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-22-768x250.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1009px) 100vw, 1009px" /></figure>



<p>We&#8217;ve gained 13 followers in 24 hours! That might not sound like much, but it&#8217;s a full 10.8% increase over where we were. Even better than that, the amount of followers vs the amount of people I&#8217;ve followed &#8211; an important metric on Twitter &#8211; has actually increased! </p>



<p>I did notice that the UI on Twitter wouldn&#8217;t let me follow people. This is dangerous, as if we try to follow too many people and get errors because our account is limited, Twitter may ban the account. We remove the follow directives, and increase retweets and likes.</p>



<h2>Day 3</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-23-1024x364.png" alt="" class="wp-image-238" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-23-1024x364.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-23-300x107.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-23-768x273.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-23.png 1048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Wow! A further 12% increase in followers! Our ratio increased again, too. That&#8217;s fantastic news&#8230; I&#8217;m greedy now, and so I&#8217;m going to increase the retweets and favorites from one per search term per hour up to 3. This should accelerate this monster&#8230; let&#8217;s wait and find out!</p>



<p>UPDATE: 3/4 the way through Day 3, let&#8217;s take a look at results. Just because I hate waiting. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-24.png" alt="" class="wp-image-239" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-24.png 977w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-24-300x119.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-24-768x306.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 977px) 100vw, 977px" /></figure>



<p>Well, that strategy appears to be working! No longer is my account limited, and also my followers increased a further 12% on top of the last 12% and 10% &#8211; an increase in rate. When we check in in another 6ish hours we&#8217;ll hopefully see that the data for the 18th reflect a massive increase.</p>



<p>What&#8217;s even better is that my follower vs followed ratio is increasing SIGNIFICANTLY. Because I&#8217;m no longer following people using the bot &#8211; although I did some manually, messing up stats &#8211; this ratio is now EXPLODING. </p>



<p>Twitter limits your ability to follow new people after you follow 5k, and if this ratio is too too deep then everyone will assume you&#8217;re digging for followers and your rate of follow backs will decrease. D&#8217;oh!</p>



<h2>Day 4</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-33-1024x761.png" alt="" class="wp-image-295" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-33-1024x761.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-33-300x223.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-33-768x571.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-33.png 1045w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Twitter: Free Money</figcaption></figure>



<p>Social traffic and engagements are literally free money if you monetize your visitors in any way, or put a dollar value on them.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-48-1024x249.png" alt="" class="wp-image-339" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-48-1024x249.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-48-300x73.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-48-768x187.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-48.png 1050w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Plus &#8211; we&#8217;ve seen a massive increase in both followers and the ratio! Booya!</p>



<h2>Day 5</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-49-1024x259.png" alt="" class="wp-image-340" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-49-1024x259.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-49-300x76.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-49-768x194.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-49.png 1035w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The followers and ratio continue their upwards trend, although slowing down&#8230;</p>



<h2>Day 6</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-50-1024x285.png" alt="" class="wp-image-341" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-50-1024x285.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-50-300x84.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-50-768x214.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-50.png 1041w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Oh! I know why my followed is still trending up. My code had a hard-coded &#8216;followback&#8217; feature. Let&#8217;s turn that off!</p>



<h2>Day 7</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-51-1024x680.png" alt="" class="wp-image-342" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-51-1024x680.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-51-300x199.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-51-768x510.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-51-120x80.png 120w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-51.png 1035w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Looking good&#8230;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-52.png" alt="" class="wp-image-343" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-52.png 1022w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-52-300x97.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-52-768x248.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1022px) 100vw, 1022px" /></figure>



<p>We&#8217;ve now accomplished the 2nd-highest daily increase in % follower/followed ratio. Hooah!</p>



<p>That concludes our 7-day adventure into automating Twitter engagements, for fun and profit. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-53.png" alt="" class="wp-image-344" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-53.png 337w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-53-300x87.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 337px) 100vw, 337px" /></figure>



<p>We&#8217;ve seen an 85% increase &#8211; nearly double! In followers over 7 days, and 30% increase in follower/followed ratio. These are huge numbers, indicative of a healthy and growing Twitter following.</p>

<h2>Introduction-ar-ily </h2>



<p>In order to both survive and thrive we need to take everything with a grain of salt, celebrate the small things and get through the small stuff. 12 Step programs are keen on &#8216;one day at a time,&#8217; but I want to offer up the only two strategies you&#8217;ll need in life (and I thank my mom for these bits of wisdom):</p>



<p>This Too Shall Pass and Onwards and Upwards</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://imgc.artprintimages.com/img/print/this-too-shall-pass_u-l-f7wkq40.jpg?h=550&amp;p=0&amp;w=550&amp;background=fbfbfb" alt="Image result for this too shall pass"/></figure>



<h2>Downs</h2>



<p>If you feel incredibly down, in a valley in the peaks and valleys sense, or a depression in the bipolar sense &#8211; <a href="https://jare.cloud/2020/01/15/why-schizophrenia-is-the-most-under-represented-of-all-the-death-sentences/">read all about the plights of mental health woes here in another article of mine</a> &#8211; it&#8217;s most important to remember these two mantras. Sometimes the world deals us blow after blow, and it might be the worst few months you&#8217;ve ever faced &#8211; you might have lost a friend or a loved one, or a job or a prospect. Whatever the reason, how we cope with these kinds of situations helps define us as a person &#8211; without the struggle, we&#8217;d never appreciate the good that comes our way with as much of our hearts as we do.</p>



<p>This Too Shall Pass teaches us that no matter how bad it gets and no matter how bleak it might seem, there&#8217;s only up from here to go. It reminds us that we&#8217;ve been through worse &#8211; and we survived. We&#8217;re strong people, and even in the worst-case scenario we can always remember some other kind of time or even compare our experiences to those we see in media or read in books. People have gotten through these traumas.. so can you. It&#8217;s not meant to belittle or take away from your pain, but give you some solace in knowing that recovery is possible. You got this!</p>



<p>Onwards and Upwards teaches us to continue putting in the effort in order to see better manifest itself in our lives. Keep trying. Keep on swimming. We must be the masters of our own destinies and fates &#8211; leaving it up to The Powers that Be (your God, her Shiva and my Science) is taking the backseat and back burner to our own lives. You have to be the mastermind and the architect, the engineer and the manual labor in effecting your own change. Nobody else will do it for you. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://i.pinimg.com/474x/0f/fd/c4/0ffdc46102b89a9ad0bfaa9eac4daf30--narnia-balloon.jpg" alt="Image result for onwards and upwards"/></figure>



<h2> Ups</h2>



<p>What can these mantras tell us about how we should react to the mountains, as opposed to the peaks? The euphoria or mania that we sometimes experience when things are looking up? Sometimes we might get taken away by the rollercoaster of emotion that happen to us in the most joyous of times &#8211; whether it be Christmas, a new baby, graduating medical school or just an unbalanced amount of chemicals in your brain along with misfiring neurons. Whatever the reason, these sayings are just as powerful now as they were in our lowest of lows.</p>



<p>This Too Shall Pass lets us know that we can always expect the buzz and elation to eventually go away &#8211; and to prepare ourselves for more battles at a later date. It&#8217;s not meant to take away from the joy we&#8217;re experiencing, but rather to give us a sobering look at how to prepare for the coming days. We can always enjoy ourselves &#8211; and thoroughly &#8211; while still being ready for the future. An excellent example is in the honeymoon stage of new relationships: most of us have felt it, and some of us have ended up in a world of hurt once the pheromones wore out. What&#8217;s the lesson? Always have a steady head and try to remember the consequences of our actions and decisions, even if they were seen in a different light &#8211; by a later you, by your friends or family, or by society at large.</p>



<p>And when we think of Onwards and Upwards, we can remember that &#8211; on a scale approaching infinity &#8211; there is actually no limit to the amounts of joy and success we can fit into a day. When things are going super well it&#8217;s best to build on that momentum and see if we can make it even better, achieve more things or invigorate ourselves to do more, see more, be more than if we didn&#8217;t have that extra motivation. This allows us to keep pushing forward &#8211; as masters of our own success &#8211; and build the building blocks of a better, safer, happier future. Even if we consider the eventual trough or downturn in our internal state, we can lay the foundation and plant the seeds of further wealth, happiness and prosperity the next time we&#8217;re back on our uppers. </p>



<h2>Finally</h2>



<p>Remember &#8211; you are the master of the universe. You are the commander of your destiny. You are the sole reason you&#8217;re still here, and the sole reason you should keep on moving forward. This might be contrary to some of your beliefs, but at least try to read it and apply it in a way that works with what you believe to be true &#8211; the more active you are in your own life and your own situation, the more effect you&#8217;ll have &#8211; and the more of what you want will manifest. You can attribute these changes where you like!</p>

<p><a href="https://jare.cloud/2020/01/19/nexo-review-for-crypto-loans-and-bitcoin-loans-and-crypto-cards-mco-visa-tenx-too/">View this article in itâ€™s original form on jare.cloud</a>!</p>



<h2>Intro</h2>



<p>What if Nexo had more than $100m USD worth of YOUR assets? More than their centralized bank-backed insurance fund protects?</p>



<p>What if Nexo began speculatively investing YOUR funds into third-party protocols, putting the capital at risk &#8211; or even losing substantial amounts of it?</p>



<p>What if Nexo, Monaco (MCO) or TenX bailed with all your funds &#8211; in massive exit scams the likes of which we have indeed seen before, at Mt. Gox or QuadrigaCX?</p>



<p>What are the alternatives for collateralized loans &#8211; where can we hedge our crypto assets, using Bitcoin or Ether or other underlyings to draw tax-friendly income? </p>



<p>Read on&#8230;</p>



<h2>Centralized Off-Chain Crypto Interest on Holdings &#8211; and Collateralized Loans Against Crypto &#8211; Seems Like a Great Idea</h2>



<p>While Nexo and Nexo clones offer some great incentives to help you feel safe &amp; secure handing over your hard-earned crypto, like a $100 million insurance fund or tax-friendly income while not spending your assets &#8211; there are huge pitfalls to trusting The Man with your units of value&#8230; with YOUR money.</p>



<p>Sure, someone may be in the position where they hold 1 BTC and want to earn a % of that 1 BTC back from an organization while doing absolutely nothing. Seems risk-free, right? &#8216;Compound your crypto&#8217; is a popular sentiment on the Internet of late &#8211; I even <a href="https://twitter.com/jarettdunn">use that phrase in my twitter bio</a>. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-34.png" alt="" class="wp-image-306" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-34.png 996w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-34-300x78.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-34-768x200.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 996px) 100vw, 996px" /></figure>



<p>What does it mean, in actual effect?</p>



<p>Well, if I have 1 BTC now and that BTC earns me 8% APR &#8211; each and every year &#8211; that 8% will earn another 8% on the 8% in year 2. </p>



<p>If we&#8217;re also long BTC, or think it&#8217;ll grow at, say, 5% average per year in value, then our resulting investment would look like this:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-35-1024x303.png" alt="" class="wp-image-307" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-35-1024x303.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-35-300x89.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-35-768x227.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-35.png 1377w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>After 10 years your BTC has nearly doubled, and the value of that BTC is up 112x&#8230;.</p>



<p>That seems to be fantastic, right? And a 5% growth on BTC per year is rather.. well, conservative, right?</p>



<h2>Other Side of That Coin</h2>



<p>Say we&#8217;re even more long on a bullish BTC, and think it&#8217;ll rise in value by &#8211; say &#8211; 30% per year. Now, we can look at Nexo or other centralized bank-backed solutions to lend US Dollar against our asset. I&#8217;m risk averse to clicking on their site, but I imagine their rates are maybe 10-14% APR. So, we lend the max. amount against our BTC at around $4500 USD, and pay 14% on the loan &#8211; while our BTC appreciates 30%.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s what that math looks like:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-36-1024x334.png" alt="" class="wp-image-308" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-36-1024x334.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-36-300x98.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-36-768x250.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-36.png 1313w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>All else remaining equal, shortly after 6 years we have ALL of our bitcoin back in appreciated value vs what we owe on our loan. </p>



<p>Let&#8217;s go even more bullish BTC &#8211; think The Halvening will grow BTC to $12k, then it&#8217;s a clear road to $20k, then moon? So do I!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-37-1024x334.png" alt="" class="wp-image-309" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-37-1024x334.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-37-300x98.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-37-768x250.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-37.png 1313w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>If BTC grows 230% in a calendar year, we effectively have a free half BTC in loaned amount in less than a year. That&#8217;s fantastic! Free money!</p>



<h2>Now, the Catch</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-38.png" alt="" class="wp-image-310" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-38.png 728w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-38-300x84.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /></figure>



<p>I wonder if Nexo has overgrown their little insurance scheme? I wonder if too many people have trusted something too good to be true &#8211; in the hands of a select few, a legal entity, and human fallacies?</p>



<p>Even more sinister, let&#8217;s say Nexo was sitting on millions of dollars in Ether. Let&#8217;s say they thought &#8211; nay, they bet on the idea &#8211; that Ether would never ever possibly depreciate past $300. Long Live Ether, right? Now, they use a third party protocol to lend against their Ether bankroll &#8211; to the tune of millions $ USD &#8211; to boost their coffers and all their marketing campaigns to draw more people into their massive &#8216;insured&#8217; ponzi. </p>



<p>Then, as we witnessed, Eth did go down. Way. Past. $300.</p>

<p>Can you think of anything more sinister&#8230; than risking people&#8217;s funds they trust your insurance to cover, then losing it? </p>



<p>Trust the banks to mess with you like this.</p>



<p>Trust custodial solutions to mess with your hard-earned cash.</p>



<h2>Monaco&#8217;s Visa Card, TenX, Populous, and the Others</h2>



<p>Nexo has another product in the pipes: a crypto-loans backed credit/debit card. When you put your crypto onto a debit/credit card, you&#8217;re actually just giving it to banks to hold onto &#8211; and with that, you&#8217;re giving them all of your personally identifiable information, as well as the right to track you and sell your data to the highest bidder (and all the other bidders with half a dollar). What this means is that you&#8217;re taking the ultimate grassroots revolution against banks and the richest 1% and giving it right back to them. This goes against everything Satoshi and all the other crypto revolutionaries had wanted with their digital cash. Do Your Own Research, and decide what&#8217;s right.</p>



<p>Moreover, existing crypto card solutions like cryptopay.me and xapo all lost their licenses for dealing with North America and loads of other places &#8211; because banks, by and large, don&#8217;t trust crypto. </p>



<p>If you need to spend your crypto look to solutions like localbitcoins.com &#8211; where you can even sell your BTC at around 1% on the dollar value to meet in person and get cold, hard cash.</p>



<h2>The Solution</h2>



<p>Never, ever trust custodial solutions! There&#8217;s such a thing as counter-party risk that&#8217;s well documented, and this is why decentralized exchanges and decentralized finance are winning with a clear advantage &#8211; employing trustless solutions where people are interacting with a tech protocol rather than an organization, person, people, or &#8211; worse yet &#8211; a bank.</p>



<p>Solutions are abound: check <a href="https://jare.cloud/2020/01/14/top-money-making-decentralized-finance-defi-applications/">my article comparing the top 6-8 decentralized finance protocols</a>.</p>



<p>Of these, a few come to mind for compounding your crypto: like <a href="https://compound.finance/">compound.finance</a>, where you can earn interest on your cryptos while holding them in your own damned wallet, secured by your own damned keys. This completely removes the counter-party risk of earning on your crypto. Almost all the other solutions in the above article like <a href="http://nuo.network/">nuo.network</a> or <a href="http://fulcrum.trade/">fulcrum.trade</a> allow you to earn, too, sometimes at higher rates &#8211; and aggregators exist, too, like <a href="http://staked.us/?pid=fr5BC09Vgc">staked.us&#8217;s Robo Advisor for Yield</a> which allows you to passively rebalance your lent portfolio.</p>



<p>Compound also allows you to borrow against your crypto assets &#8211; all on-chain, all non-custodial. You own your own keys. You can receive a number of stablecoins for your Ether or other tokens, or even borrow against non-stable assets &#8211; the choice is yours to long or short whatever you like. </p>



<p>They currently don&#8217;t support borrowing against BTC or the BTC-backed Wrapped BTC (WBTC), but have no fear! Fulcrum.trade has a sister-site powered by the same protocol <a href="https://torque.loans/">https://torque.loans/</a>  where &#8211; at present &#8211; you can get $4800 in stablecoins for your 1 WBTC.</p>

<h2>The Verdict</h2>



<p>Never, ever trust The Man with your money. That&#8217;s the point of Blockchain. Banks, governments will collapse and fail, the ATMs will stop giving you money and gas will stop being delivered to your favorite gas stations &#8211; food will stop being delivered to your supermarkets &#8211; but crypto will not fail because the protocols are run without the interference or governance of man (or woman, or other).</p>



<p>Tired of The Man earning from your browsing habits, personally identifiable information and by selling your data? Try the <a href="https://jare.cloud/2020/01/15/better-web-brave-rewards-your-content-make-money-monetizing-twitter/">Brave browser, which not only protects all of your data and privacy,</a> but also axes all those damaging ads around the web &#8211; delivering you a faster, safer browsing experience!</p>

<p>Fomo3D was a dangerous game theory that was then applied, obfuscated, and raked in a sh#tton of cold, hard cash.</p>



<p>Users would sign up for <a href="https://exitscam.me/">https://exitscam.me/</a> and play the game. Their greed would ensure they always spent more than they lost in an auction that Harvard Business School teaches their pupils &#8211; it&#8217;s called a &#8216;War of Attrition.&#8217;</p>



<p>When offered the chance to bid on a $20 bill with $1, people will bid on it. The problem is this: the 2nd highest bid also has to pay whenever the winner is chosen. So, when the bid is $19 and the prize is $20, someone will surely bid to make a dollar. Now, when you&#8217;re the $18 bid you might lose your $18 if you don&#8217;t bid again &#8211; paying $20 for $20. If you win, you&#8217;re down $0. If you don&#8217;t bid, and lose now, you&#8217;re down $18. </p>



<p>What&#8217;s the person with the $19 bid do?</p>



<p>There&#8217;s been documented cases where the bidding reached a walloping $4000 &#8211; in a display of sheer ego. The loser was caught up in the ecstasy of playing the game.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s exactly what Fomo3D did, except the winnings were divvied up in a very smart way that wasn&#8217;t previously available to the general public: using an underlying dividend-paying or burning token (forget which) they cleverly increased the token value or delivered payments for token holders when people played the game.</p>



<p>This caused a huge social effort by token holders &#8211; and game players &#8211; to spread FOMO about the game around the internet. This would bring in new players and &#8211; occasionally &#8211; those who would even win or lose by ego, or win or lose because of the sheer thrill of the game.</p>



<p>Learning all of this tonight for the first time, I did a brief Google on &#8216;dangerous game theory&#8217; and was actually learning about game theory for the first time in my life. Now, this shit is fun. And profitable.</p>



<p>I read about War of Attrition. What a beautiful concept. </p>



<p>The wikipedia article linked to a few other sources: Chicken, another dangerous game theory, has a fancy theory name &#8211; but it&#8217;s still chicken. When one veers off they lose, when both collide they both lose. We&#8217;ll examine opportunities here at a later date, but I also came across another interesting concept.</p>



<p>The prisoner&#8217;s dilemma is that two guys are caught for selling drugs, and both are facing 2 years for sure. The feds think they&#8217;re both involved in a much more serious crime, and tell Prisoner A that he&#8217;ll get 3 years if they both confess &#8211; but if he confesses, and Prisoner B doesn&#8217;t, he&#8217;ll get 1 year and Prisoner B will get 10. Now, if he denies and Prisoner B confesses, then he will get 10 years and Prisoner B will get 1 year.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-25.png" alt="" class="wp-image-242" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-25.png 645w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-25-300x84.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 645px) 100vw, 645px" /></figure>



<p>What the feds don&#8217;t mention is the final outcome: if they both deny, they&#8217;re both faced with 2 years. This is what&#8217;s referred to as the &#8216;globally optimal solution&#8217; &#8211; meaning that if I was able to talk to the other prisoner we might both deny.</p>



<p>What&#8217;s in my best interest, as Prisoner 1?</p>



<p>Well, it looks as though no matter what I do &#8211; without knowing the other party&#8217;s intentions &#8211; confessing is my best option. I either face 1 year &#8211; which is great &#8211; or three years. However, I&#8217;m completely avoiding the possibility that I might get 10 years &#8211; which is the worst-case scenario. Both of us confessing isn&#8217;t the best optimal answer on the board, but it&#8217;s what&#8217;s best without knowing the other party&#8217;s intentions &#8211; we call this the Nash Equilibrium, after famous mathematician John Nash. This is applied extensively to playing poker &#8211; where it applies just as much. </p>



<p>Nash was also one of the most famous schizophrenics, and the subject of the movie A Beautiful Mind. Want to read more about how people with schizophrenia think? <a href="https://jare.cloud/2020/01/14/how-do-people-with-mental-health-illnesses-like-schizophrenia-or-other-psychoses-think/">Check out this article I wrote on psychotic thoughts</a> (from first-hand experience!)</p>



<p>Now, if we flip these numbers to their inverse and do some jiggery pokery, we can come up with a profitable business idea for anyone to rake in huge amounts of capital from tokensales and giving people the opportunity to have fun &#8211; and potentially win big.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-27.png" alt="" class="wp-image-244" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-27.png 658w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-27-300x83.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 658px) 100vw, 658px" /></figure>



<p>Say my risk is that I might lose all of my 2 Ether deposit on betting in this game. The funds are locked in smart contract. If I go with Option 2, there&#8217;s a chance that I could lose my whole balance or there&#8217;s a chance I might get 1.7 of my ether back. OK, good enough.</p>



<p>If I choose Option 1, there&#8217;s a chance I get 1.3 of my Ether back or &#8211; here&#8217;s the kicker &#8211; I might get 2.3 of my ether back (and &#8216;win&#8217;) should Player 2 choose option 2.</p>



<p>Logic would say that a rational person wants their chance at winning, and will always go with Option 1. Whereas, if both players do, then they both lose. Right?</p>



<p>So far this isn&#8217;t very promising as a dangerous game.</p>



<p>However, enter an oraclized call to a random number generator choosing 50/50 either option 1 or option 2, as player 2. Sure, this player would need to put funds up first in order to play &#8211; which might come from project funds or from tokenholders putting up the funds against people that lock up Eth in a contract &#8211; but check this out, here&#8217;s what would happen in Game 1:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-28-1024x154.png" alt="" class="wp-image-245" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-28-1024x154.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-28-300x45.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-28-768x115.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-28-1536x231.png 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-28.png 1750w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Player 1 will always (rationally) choose option 1. The RNG chooses 50/50 options 1 or 2. In green/yellow are the possible outcomes for player 1: they either get 1.3 Ether if they lose, or 2.3 ether if they win. Now, no rational GAMBLER would play these odds &#8211; but, keep listening! There&#8217;s a 50% chance that the pot wins 0.7 Ether, and a 50% chance it loses 0.3 Ether. Fair enough, so averaging out our winnings that&#8217;s 0.2 Ether.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m going to take this Ether and add half to the game pot. The other half I&#8217;m going to use to give value to my game token &#8211; by buy n burn or dividends.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s look what happens in Game 2:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-29-1024x123.png" alt="" class="wp-image-246" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-29-1024x123.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-29-300x36.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-29-768x92.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-29-1536x184.png 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-29.png 1743w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Now we&#8217;re talking, we&#8217;ve sweetened the pot that the Player has a 50/50 chance of winning &#8211; with half the house&#8217;s winnings from each game before that reinvested back into the pot. There&#8217;s a chance they win &#8211; and pot doesn&#8217;t increase, no new token burn or dividends happen. There&#8217;s half a chance they lose again &#8211; and it&#8217;s added to the pot and increases the value of the token.</p>



<p>Etc etc tending towards infinity, the potential winnings for playing the game increase ever so much while they&#8217;re still losing 1/2 the time playing against the evil supercomputer. </p>



<p>3rd game? More money to be won! Eventually, the gambler&#8217;s odds increase enough to be a worthwhile bet no matter what &#8211; and the token&#8217;s value continues to increase with each average result of the game. This creates a frenzy of people spreading news about the game, drawing more and more people and money into the game.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-30-1024x124.png" alt="" class="wp-image-247" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-30-1024x124.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-30-300x36.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-30-768x93.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-30-1536x186.png 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-30.png 1730w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>What does this mean for me, penning this article? Even though I don&#8217;t have a smart contract developer or a budget, at least now I own the Intellectual Property on this new evolution of a Dangerous Game Theory smart contract game. If you are a smart contract developer and would like to team up, let me know! If I&#8217;ve made any critical errors in my math &#8211; it wouldn&#8217;t be the first time! Let me know!</p>



<p>Now that we&#8217;ve talked about having the benefits of those with beautiful minds &#8211; <a href="https://jare.cloud/2020/01/15/why-schizophrenia-is-the-most-under-represented-of-all-the-death-sentences/">let&#8217;s talk about the challenges schizophrenics face</a>, in this article I wrote!</p>
