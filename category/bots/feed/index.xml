<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/image-1-473x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-130" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/image-1-473x1024.png 473w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/12/image-1-139x300.png 139w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/12/image-1.png 591w" sizes="(max-width: 473px) 100vw, 473px" /></figure>



<h2>Steps to Reproduce</h2>



<p>Step 1. Join our Telegram https://t.me/joinchat/G3tz4RdZGmNdxs9vXdum7A<br> Step 2. Create a net-new Binance account, and enable futures, and create an api key after enabling futures http://www.binance.com/en/register?ref=27039658, You&#8217;re allowed to have as many Binance accounts as you like, while only verifying one &#8211; the max daily withdrawal on an unverified account is still huge<br> Step 3: Sent the subscription fee to our wallet 0x55FC78F760fBeb15A8a14ce2B8e9DCfA4CE0f966<br> Step 4: Enter your transaction ID on this form.<br> Step 5: And the last 6 characters of your API key.<br> Step 6: The team will manually add you to the bot&#8217;s license, and send you the executable file and other directions.<br> Step 7: Run the appropriate exports or setx&#8217;s from within env.sh. DO NOT simply run env.sh, it won&#8217;t work, copy and paste the commands into a terminal/cmd window. On windows, open a net new cmd when finished.<br> Step 8: Run the executable for app for BTCUSDT, eth for ETHUSDT, and balance for a balance output graph like the ones you&#8217;re used to seeing.</p>

<h2>Neomenia FAQs</h2>



<h1>FAQ 1: Settings</h1>



<p>variables with ‘eth’ prepended are the same, for the ethusdt bot<br></p>



<p>delaybetweenorder, higher for more delay before a new limit order</p>



<p>takeProfit, in % what gains to lock in before market out</p>



<p>stopLoss, in % what losses to accept before market out</p>



<p>tgUser, your Telegram username for use with the Telegram bot</p>



<p>key, APIkey</p>



<p>secret, APIsecret<br></p>



<p>&#8212;-<br></p>



<p>Note that the key and secret are never communicated anywhere off the local machine, except in signed requests to the exchange (which hide your details). Wireshark sniffing can confirm this.<br></p>



<p>&#8212;-<br></p>



<p>site, the http or https address where your server is located. You can google curl ipify to find your address if you’re in a headless server, or google ‘what is my ip’ if you have an interface. You can set up DNS forwarding on duckdns.org or register your own spiffy shiny new domain if you like.</p>



<p>poirt, which port to run the balance server on. Use 80 for http 443 for https (which isn’t enabled anyhow) or a higher number like 8080 if you’re having permissions issues.</p>



<p>maxFreePerc, what maximum % of the wallet will be used before stopping ordering in the same direction. Note this doesn’t count existing limit orders, which could max our margin if your delay is too small.</p>



<p>orderSizeMult, for a $50 USDT account use 5, for $250 use 1, for $500 use 0.5. Etc.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/image-3-1024x549.png" alt="" class="wp-image-132" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/image-3-1024x549.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/12/image-3-300x161.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/12/image-3-768x412.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/12/image-3.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2>FAQ 2: Legal Mumbo Jumbo</h2>



<p>In no way are our team or any affiliated member responsible for any gains or losses you might experience. Previous action is no indication implied or assured of future performance. Risk only what you can afford to lose. This bot does not constitute financial advice by any means, and is meant to be used in an educational, communal, and fun format.</p>

<p>Note: these directions come without much conversation, let the hacking begin!</p>



<p>Set up a Bot with @BotFather<br> </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-34.png" alt="" class="wp-image-110" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-34.png 641w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-34-289x300.png 289w" sizes="(max-width: 641px) 100vw, 641px" /></figure>



<p>Create a package.json</p>

 app.listen(8000, () => console.log("Telegram bot is listening on port 8000!"));</code></pre>



<p>Note: it&#8217;s important to send a res.end in every case, or else your bot will get hung up on old messages it couldn&#8217;t process and no res.end was sent &#8211; putting it in a forever loop of never sending a response!</p>



<p>set your env key</p>



<p><code>export key="whateverbotfathergaveyou"</code></p>



<p>npm i</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-30-1024x130.png" alt="" class="wp-image-101" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-30-1024x130.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-30-300x38.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-30-768x97.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-30.png 1255w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>In the quantitative finance world, there are some holy grails: you can decrease the risk of an exposed position generally by doing something in the opposite direction.</p>



<p>In the simplest form, we can both long and short in two opposite positions on exchanges that use the long-short model like OkEx. In doing so, a price movement up or down will have the exact same effect on your position &#8211; where you&#8217;re losing fees and only fees.</p>



<p>In reality, that&#8217;s no good because we don&#8217;t want to be losing on every trade <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p>What I&#8217;ve decided to try my hand at is something called a &#8216;long straddle.&#8217; This was mentioned during my interview with Coindex Labs a long time ago &#8211; but basically, if you buy a put option and buy a call option &#8216;out of the money&#8217; it&#8217;s relatively cheap &#8211; if the price doesn&#8217;t move at all, they both expire worthless. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-31.png" alt="" class="wp-image-102" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-31.png 741w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-31-300x178.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 741px) 100vw, 741px" /></figure>



<p>But: if the price increases OR decreases a significant amount, one of those options expires in the money.. meaning it gianed value from potentially nothing into potentially something!</p>



<p>What this means is that, while the market maker is performing within specifications and earning money from low price volatility and volumes on the bid/ask, these options can expire worthless and our income from market making pays for the expired options &#8211; and then more!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-32-1024x161.png" alt="" class="wp-image-103" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-32-1024x161.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-32-300x47.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-32-768x121.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-32-1536x241.png 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-32.png 1649w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>If the market moves too much in one direction, we&#8217;re risking liquidating our funds if we hold market making positions that go sour.</p>



<p>If this happens &#8211; one of our long straddle options expires &#8216;in the money&#8217; enough for us to cover our losses. What this means is risk-free trading &#8211; so long as the assumption holds true that the market making earns more than the cost of the options.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-33-1024x108.png" alt="" class="wp-image-104" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-33-1024x108.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-33-300x32.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-33-768x81.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-33.png 1247w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>In my code, we loop through all the expiries and all the strikes for all the options, and then find the one whose ratio of cost vs. profits for a 15% movement in price (which is 100% liquidated at 6.66x leverage) yields the minimum threshold we need to cover $15 000 in exposed futures ($99 900 notional). In our example output, the Dec 6 options straddle for $6250 put and $9750 call would cost a total of 0.017 BTC for both the long put and long call, and each would earn $342 profit if the underlying price moved 15% and all else remained the same. This means that spending 0.54 BTC would completely cover the risk of liquidating 2 BTC exposed at 6.66x leverage &#8211; at least until implied volatilities change significantly or time value declines as we approach expiry! When these situations occur, the hedging bot would just create new orders in real-time to hedge the risk. Hooah!</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://scontent.fyhz1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.15752-9/76702405_2533273790105081_4583222162055233536_n.png?_nc_cat=108&amp;_nc_ohc=4Vbyg5W14HwAQkZ8wLiECu10yKgvGxixDMyWU4xvTgW1tmhU24esQj0Cg&amp;_nc_ht=scontent.fyhz1-1.fna&amp;oh=418a76a2031e74a257d7ae938573091e&amp;oe=5E405713" alt=""/><figcaption><br></figcaption></figure>



<p>Today Coindex Lab&#8217;s CEO had a sitdown with a capital markets guy and then later Two Sigma Ventures &#8211; with the goal of making Coindex a fighting force in quantitative finance.</p>



<p>The good news? Capital markets guy wanted us to start a hedgefund. A random guy from the other coast approached the conversation out of nowhere asking to be connected.</p>



<p>Later, the conversation with TSV yielded &#8216;Good news and bad news:&#8217;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-28.png" alt="" class="wp-image-96" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-28.png 1011w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-28-300x229.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-28-768x587.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1011px) 100vw, 1011px" /></figure>



<p>So we have two &#8211; maybe three! &#8211; pledges for funds when we figure out the legalize of doing so.</p>



<p>The good news for me is that I get both equity share and a cut of the vig (gangster term for the take).</p>



<p>The good news for my readers is that we have the opportunity to get capital into Coindex at ground floor, and start earning on crypto and traditional markets with our patented edge over any given set of market conditions.</p>



<p>You might ask yourself, then ask me, &#8216;but I&#8217;m not a high net worth individual &#8211; how can I contribute to a hedgefund?&#8217;</p>



<p>Well, in keeping with crypto tradition&#8230;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-29.png" alt="" class="wp-image-97" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-29.png 938w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-29-300x137.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-29-768x350.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 938px) 100vw, 938px" /></figure>



<p>We very well might crowdfund in an STO!</p>



<p>While this is still a gleam in the back of my eye and ultimately a rumor &#8211; what this means is that you &#8211; your friends, coworkers, acquaintances, grandma &#8211; can capitalize on <strong><a href="https://hackernoon.com/coindex-labs-novel-search-applied-via-evolutionary-ai-creating-a-money-making-machine-n62j2gei">our value proposition</a></strong>, and learn from my years of experience <a href="https://hackernoon.com/what-ive-learned-from-years-of-arbitrage-and-market-making-975w38rs"><strong>making markets and doing arbitrage trading</strong></a> and <strong><a href="https://hackernoon.com/porting-a-bot-to-binance-futures-market-making-competition-6v6a31qh">derive alphas from our bots</a></strong>!</p>

<p><a href="https://dunncreativess.github.io/2019/11/20/complaint-about-bitmexs-websocket-api-and-update-on-profitable-market-makers/">See this article in it&#8217;s original form, on dunncreativess.github.io</a>!</p>



<h2>BitMex Taking Away From Their API</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-23-1024x278.png" alt="" class="wp-image-87" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-23-1024x278.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-23-300x81.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-23-768x209.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-23.png 1443w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>In BitMex&#8217;s official nodejs websocket api connector README.md, they mention &#8216;order creation&#8217; via authenticated websocket.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-24.png" alt="" class="wp-image-88" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-24.png 981w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-24-300x111.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-24-768x283.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 981px) 100vw, 981px" /></figure>



<p>Lo and behold, their web hosted websocket docs removed that functionality.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-25-1024x808.png" alt="" class="wp-image-89" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-25-1024x808.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-25-300x237.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-25-768x606.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-25.png 1076w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Common knowledge says their sample market maker they have on GitHub was set up to do websocket orders, but lo! behold! Their market maker has been updated to do all POST-style commands via REST.</p>



<p>:'(</p>



<p>The result is that our Market Making bot template with Coindex Labs hits rate limits incredibly fast when creating or editing orders, and when we enable our rate limiter we see loop times approaching 1min over 4 instruments (BTC perp, ETH perp, BTC futures) and 3 max orders for bid/ask each. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-26.png" alt="" class="wp-image-90" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-26.png 861w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-26-300x202.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-26-768x517.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-26-120x80.png 120w" sizes="(max-width: 861px) 100vw, 861px" /></figure>



<p>Woe is me!</p>



<p>With high-frequency trading one of the key aspects is &#8216;high frequency,&#8217; (no.. no joke!)</p>



<p>The bot, however, is showing net net positive deltas:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-27-1024x387.png" alt="" class="wp-image-91" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-27-1024x387.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-27-300x113.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-27-768x290.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-27.png 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>This brings us to our next section: </p>



<h2>Profitable Market Making Bots!</h2>



<p>Our deribit testnet bot is up nearly 500% on equity, while livenet broke it&#8217;s 10% gains and sits happily around 15%.. in less than a week!</p>



<p>Binance Futures Market Maker will be in play in the coming weeks.. but their 0% fees after a once-a-day rebate might kill the strategy. Woe!</p>



<p>BitMex has much, much more taker volume on their high-volume instruments.. so gains should be more quick to realize! Time will tell!</p>



<h2>Look! A plug!</h2>



<p>Some of these market makers could easily be made available for sale, while there are two READ: two whole bots coming available for sale by people who&#8217;ve hired me in Telegram.</p>

<h2>Make Markets Across Markets!</h2>



<p>Market making is an art. Like pure arbitrage, the math behind making markets in high- or low-frequency trading makes it very unlikely to lose big &#8211; while the small, incremental gains over time mean that you&#8217;ll receive predictable and measurable gains.</p>



<p>This is made possible, for the most part, by having an edge over a market or a combination of markets &#8211; like market maker rebates, or reduced fees. When your trades have an advantage over the average trader or algorithm, you&#8217;ve got a sure-bet to win <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p>In lamen&#8217;s terms we automate both sides of the bid/ask spread, until such time as we&#8217;re too far exposed in one side of the equation and then we wait to settle those positions. The % amounts of balance we&#8217;re exposed the trigger this safety behavior are configurable in these bots &#8211; all of the input variables are!</p>



<p>And while we&#8217;ve seen ~10% net ROI in less than a week and $hundreds thousands notional ETH and $millions notional BTC traded on one exchange, we&#8217;d like to get people churning deltas, alphas and notionals with subscriptions!</p>



<p>The exchanges we&#8217;re looking to support at first are those with market making fee rebates or a fee structure that&#8217;s condusive to a better trading experience &#8211; ie. Okex has a tiered fee structure that decreases with volume, which is superior to Binance&#8217;s fee tiers that decrease with volume but also require holding illiquid BNB.</p>

<p>The above screenshot may not seem like much&#8230; but it&#8217;s the culmination of a genius moment and 11 lines of code (along with one NPM library very slightly rewritten &#8211; replacing the word &#8216;margin&#8217; with &#8216;futures&#8217; in one spot!)</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>pnlusd = -1 * (1 - bal_usd / usd_init) * 100
 if (pnlusd > ((min_withdrawal_perecent * 100) * 2)) {
     var new_usd_init = bal_usd * (1 - (min_withdrawal_perecent));
     binance.mgTransferMarginToMain('USDT', (min_withdrawal_perecent) * bal_usd, (error, response) => {
         if (error) {
             console.log(error)
         } else {
            usd_init = new_usd_init
            initial_bal = usd_init / LB;
        }
    });
}</code></pre>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-21-1024x443.png" alt="" class="wp-image-80" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-21-1024x443.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-21-300x130.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-21-768x332.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-21-1536x664.png 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-21.png 1778w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>When my PNL delta reached 5%, above, my min_withdrawal_perecent variable of 0.025 triggered the code block that withdrew 2.5% of my income from my futures wallet into my exchange wallet. The remaining 2.5% was left inside the futures wallet. </p>



<p>What this means, in actual effect, is that my $5.98 in USDT is now safely in my exchange wallet and the futures bot has no more access to it.</p>



<p>What this means is.. slowly, over time, I&#8217;ll gain back my initial deposit as gains that now cannot be lost unless I risk them again!</p>



<p>What&#8217;s more is that the 2.5% left in the futures account will add to the order sizes, increasing the returns and &#8211; over time &#8211; giving a compounding interest on the returns.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-22.png" alt="" class="wp-image-82" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-22.png 808w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-22-280x300.png 280w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-22-768x822.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 808px) 100vw, 808px" /></figure>



<p>People are thrilled&#8230;</p>



<p>As a note on my previous article, the cost is $59/mo and $10 to affiliates &#8211; AND a $10/mo off if you sign up using our Binance referral link!</p>



<p><a href="https://github.com/DunnCreativeSS/binanceBots/">Check out some of my Binance opensource bots here</a>!</p>



<p>Next Steps?</p>



<p>Stay tuned for our website (maybe on a github.io!) that allows you to pay a month in crypto to sign up for the bot. It&#8217;ll allow you to enter your api key and secret within the browser session, then that same browser session will spwan a google cloud compute instance with those keys &#8211; communicating directly with GCP, without us having any access to those keys! The GCP instance will be spawned with a random SSH key that&#8217;s then thrown away into the abyss of cleared memory! This magic was achieved once before for a bot I&#8217;d created, and I can sure as heck do it again &#8211; and the site will be opensource for auditing purposes. This is better than us asking for keys and leagues better than us giving out our source code, and GCP micro instances are CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP!</p>

<p>With nearly 31 BTC notional traded in recent memory, this bot Proof Of Concept even survived last night&#8217;s dump and subsequent pump and ended up 6% ROI after all was said and done. Aweo!</p>



<p>You can <a href="http://patbot1.duckdns.org/">follow the delta graph for this so-far unnamed bot here</a>.</p>



<p>The competing bot with like logic &#8211; less one indicator to confirm &#8211; lost a good 5% ROI during that dump &amp; pump. Less risk = more reward, in this sense!</p>



<p>This bot&#8217;s performance at 20x leverage on Binance Futures is defined by it&#8217;s subroutines, finding price action among an index vs. another index (sorry can&#8217;t divulge more because of NDA) then acting when it&#8217;s doubly confirmed by a volume and a price volatility indicator. For the win!</p>



<p>The best news? This bot&#8217;s creator (who shall remain unnamed for the time being, until he decides to come to light&#8230;) will be charging a monthly subscription fee of $59 USDT &#8211; and $10 USDT of that goes to affiliate referrers, indefinitely!</p>



<p><a href="https://t.me/ManyVolumeSignalMonster">Sign up for our Telegram bot chat room here</a>, to discuss eligibility for coming onboard this bot in it&#8217;s alpha v1.0 form or starting to refer people to it for your own fun &amp; profit!</p>



<p>In more detail, let&#8217;s look at the most recent hour&#8217;s graph of delta on delta&#8230;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-16-1024x393.png" alt="" class="wp-image-71" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-16-1024x393.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-16-300x115.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-16-768x295.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-16-1536x590.png 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-16.png 1827w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Recovering from a 1.5% loss when it entered into a larger position, it&#8217;s slowly climbed from there &#8211; reaching a whopping 31.5% delta and a current +0.617 BTC position.</p>



<p>Running this bot on other balances with other risk factors has been enlightening &#8211; following a liquidation of a small balance at 125x in a dump a few nights ago, the safer bets have been on smaller leverage and smaller order sizes.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-17-1024x45.png" alt="" class="wp-image-72" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-17-1024x45.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-17-300x13.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-17-768x34.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-17.png 1113w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-18-1024x200.png" alt="" class="wp-image-73" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-18-1024x200.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-18-300x59.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-18-768x150.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-18.png 1119w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-2-1024x722.png" alt="" class="wp-image-19" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-2-1024x722.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-2-300x212.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-2-768x542.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-2.png 1428w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption><br></figcaption></figure>



<p>It&#8217;s been a busy few days for me!</p>



<h2>What&#8217;s Current</h2>



<p>As I&#8217;d mentioned on Hackernoon before, <a href="https://hackernoon.com/porting-a-bot-to-binance-futures-market-making-competition-6v6a31qh">Coindex and I are admitted into the Binance Futures Market Making Competition</a>. This bot is currently being fed into the AI with competing genomes using different input variables, to give us the winning generations in terms of configurations. We&#8217;re running this market making bot on Deribit testnet and livenet &#8211; showing 10% gains on livenet, almost 50% on testnet, but these livenet results aren&#8217;t being published anywhere &#8211; yet!</p>



<p><a href="http://coindexbot.duckdns.org:8080/">You can watch the market maker on Deribit testnet in realtime here</a> &#8211; which will soon be integrated to <a href="https://coindexlabs.com/">coindexlabs.com</a>!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-3-1024x398.png" alt="" class="wp-image-20" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-3-1024x398.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-3-300x117.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-3-768x299.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-3-1536x597.png 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-3.png 1896w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Next up is the first bot I was hired to create in the last week. Without breaching terms of NDA, it executes trades based on a series of custom price action indicators confirmed twice by regular ol&#8217; indicators. It&#8217;s currently up 0.7% in the last three hours on Binance Futures <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><br><br>You can <a href="http://patbot1.duckdns.org/">watch it live with one indicator confirming trend here</a>, <a href="http://patbo2.duckdns.org/">or two indicators to lessen the noise here</a>!</p>



<p>This bot will be available for a small subscription fee in the future times, and the benefactor has even agreed to share some of that subscription money with me &#8211; for the win! It&#8217;s so far been running 2-3 days in profit. Aweo! This bot&#8217;s ideationmaster has given me more and more income to add indicators, exchanges, and in the future it will even have Telegram bot reporting. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f600.png" alt="😀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-4-1024x500.png" alt="" class="wp-image-21" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-4-1024x500.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-4-300x147.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-4-768x375.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-4-1536x750.png 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-4.png 1892w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>A second bot I was created to hire uses a genius system to identify support and resistence, and enters in Binance Futures limit post-only too &#8211; exiting when trends reverse at market and entering in new post-only orders to win in the next trend. It&#8217;s currently up 6.5% although it hasn&#8217;t traded in a little while, have no fear! It requires the trend to be confirmed one way or another over the course of some other safety inputs.</p>



<p><a href="http://coindexbot.duckdns.org/">You can watch the delta of the delta for this one live here</a>. I don&#8217;t know if this bot&#8217;s benefactor wants to sell access to his creations or just throw some serious capital at them &#8211; stay tuned for details! Either way, he has decided he&#8217;s going to continue feeding me bot projects so I can concentrate on being productive while having the ol&#8217; rent paid <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<h2>What&#8217;s Next</h2>



<p>Coindex and myself and some of the bot ideationmasters we&#8217;ve mentioned will be working on ways to hedge losses in the case our bots see stoplosses.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-5-1024x542.png" alt="" class="wp-image-22" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-5-1024x542.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-5-300x159.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-5-768x406.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-5-1536x813.png 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-5.png 1890w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>What this means for Coindex at least is to use different entries for long calls+puts on the same instrument and expiry, which is called a long straddle or strangle. If the price moves up OR down significantly (causing losses on market makers) then the options will go out of money and simultaneously in the money at the same time, and at leverage on a deriviative one of them will be worth some serious money! While we&#8217;re happy to use Deribit for this, we&#8217;re excited to see a new player: Binance JEX, which supports options on many more types of underlyings. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f600.png" alt="😀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f600.png" alt="😀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p>What&#8217;s beautiful in the above screenshot (among other things&#8230;) is the dynamic leverage based on volatility. One can hedge using a fraction of the funds and balance one&#8217;s exposure with their hedging &#8211; and while the market maker makes money and the options lose money, we&#8217;re still smiling. When the market maker hits stoplosses and the options make money &#8211; we&#8217;re still laughing. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
