<h2>#1: You&#8217;ll Always be Pleasantly Surprised</h2>



<p>This is actually a secret my mom taught me over and over again. If you expect the worst possible outcome in any given situation &#8211; love, relationships, family, work &#8211; then whatever does come to pass will certainly be better than your expectations!</p>



<p>In such a way, you&#8217;ll find little joys throughout your day and week. These little joys will create a sense of reward that you might not have had if you were constantly being let down by your own expectations.</p>



<p>Framing your world in a different light can have certain advantages &#8211; for those with very specific minds, you might lose touch with the &#8216;real reality&#8217; and become a concern for your own self&#8217;s well-being. Read an article I wrote on how <a href="https://jare.cloud/2020/01/14/how-do-people-with-mental-health-illnesses-like-schizophrenia-or-other-psychoses-think/">people with schizophrenia and mental health can actually think</a> (from first-hand experience).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/2118/2511788463_03d9281e2e_z.jpg" alt="Image result for pleasant surprise"/></figure>



<h2>#2: Emergency Preparedness Saves Lives</h2>



<p>In a much more literal sense, being prepared for the worst will mean that you create disaster recovery plans &#8211; be they for the zombie apocalypse, should your car die and need repairs you can&#8217;t immediately afford, or if the lights go out for a day or two &#8211; having a plan improves your chances of getting through the scenario measurably. </p>



<p>This is so true that a brief Google search returns many millions islands (results, in Google English Pirate language) for &#8217;emergency preparedness course,&#8217; <a href="https://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/aclk?sa=L&amp;ai=DChcSEwjL39ilpYvnAhVN1sAKHex_BzcYABAAGgJpbQ&amp;ohost=www.google.com&amp;cid=CAESQOD2M1X01icn_Ddsj9d_VtuSw2OJzkWb-hMqPuHbRQdhjHlW1fmxM4R73TFopbDePIk6WevtDEoZfVqZPTnors0&amp;sig=AOD64_0WZlRmA4DrGAF_Av58ZgcPrRp7aA&amp;q=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwixoc2lpYvnAhXFWc0KHTQqBxIQ0Qx6BAgQEAE&amp;adurl=">like this one at a Canadian university</a>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-19-1024x696.png" alt="" class="wp-image-231" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-19-1024x696.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-19-300x204.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-19-768x522.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-19.png 1178w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2>#3: You&#8217;ll Be Ready for Anything</h2>



<p>Hand in hand with being prepared for the worst-case scenario, you&#8217;ll also be ready for all the other scenarios up and down the range of possible outcomes &#8211; from the best possible ones right down to what could potentially be the absolute worst. Because you have considered and somehow either counted or discounted each possible route, you will have a plan for accomplishing things regardless of how fate will twist your arm. </p>



<p>As you get more and more used to this mental exercise, you&#8217;ll notice that your breadth of perception will naturally expand &#8211; as you&#8217;ll be considering more &#8216;twists of fate,&#8217; having added personal experience and the nature of the universe as it tends towards infinity. What I mean to say, rather, is that as the Powers That Be (whatever you subscribe to) throw new and unexpected curveballs your way, your brain will naturally plan for even more possibilities and outcomes. This will expand your mind way better than the hippie in highschool promised you Lysergic Acid Diethylamide ever could have come close to.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e83b3f710949ba6d82614821d6d3f93dd1786b9/0_1020_3125_1875/master/3125.jpg?width=300&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=7fd40712c4db8af6b93a0ab9580243a9" alt="Image result for lsd"/></figure>



<h2>#4: You&#8217;ll Achieve More Goals</h2>



<p>Well, #3 was a bit of a doublethink mindfuck. What does it translate to, practically? Why should it be encouraging, rather than something to be afraid of?</p>



<p>In reality, creating new and interesting ways to approach problems will give you new and novel ways of conquering those problems. Your new disaster emergency preparedness attitude &#8211; when applied to everything &#8211; will allow you to accomplish more and more of your goals, more and more frequently. </p>



<p>This has a fantastic effect on your mindset, and overall happiness. If you do end up doing the things you set out to do more often than you do now, or even in fashions you hadn&#8217;t considered before, then you&#8217;ll have more and more dopamine for your pleasure centers &#8211; which means a happier, healthier you!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://images.saba.com/uploads/blog/what-should-you-do-when-you-dont-accomplish-your-goals/what-should-you-do-when-you-dont-accomplish-your-goals.jpg?s=1696x900" alt="Image result for accomplish"/></figure>



<h2>Bonus: Win Friends and Influence Enemies</h2>



<p>With a happier, healthier you comes a number of bonus effects &#8211; like a boost in charisma, confidence, ability. This truly is a snowball effect of positive outcomes.</p>



<p>When you present yourself better &#8211; or at least, more confidently &#8211; it results in people taking you more seriously, or appreciating you (or at least, your opinions and voice) more and more. This will allow you to gain more traction at work, home, and play. </p>



<p>It will allow you to harness your new-found powers of persuasion in two important ways. First, you&#8217;ll be able to befriend more people more frequently &#8211; winning their approval and allowing them to become proponents of whatever causes or values you subscribe to. Second, you&#8217;ll be able to exert your newfound influence over people who might detract from your causes or values &#8211; allowing you to gain more of a say over the people who would do you ill or harm (even just on the theoretical, intellectual level).</p>



<p>Did I interest you already about the ways in which a segregated, compartmentalized mindset can be a blessing &#8211; and a curse? <a href="https://jare.cloud/2020/01/15/why-schizophrenia-is-the-most-under-represented-of-all-the-death-sentences/">Read my other article here on how schizophrenia increases your chances of an early end to your mortal turmoil</a> (read again: it&#8217;s a fatal diagnosis. No, no joke!)</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Ad%2BUal74L.jpg" alt="Image result for win friends influence people"/></figure>



<h2>Bonus (Voice of Reason!) #2: This Is Actually a Lot of Work</h2>



<p>When you&#8217;re tasking your mind with so much data to consume and analyze, you&#8217;re actually spending a lot more time thinking about yourself and your surroundings, experiences and misconceptions an awful lot more than you are should you not be exercising this theory. This can translate to an awful lot of work &#8211; something that might end up tasking you to a point where it can do more harm than good.</p>



<p>Truly, if you become preoccupied by this exercise and it gets in the way of goals rather than helping them &#8211; or prevents you from performing at work, home, school, or anywhere &#8211; then it might not be worth the time that goes into it. As with anything, it&#8217;s good in moderation &#8211; and we should always exercise a good balance in our own minds.</p>

<p><a href="http://jare.cloud/2020/01/15/why-schizophrenia-is-the-most-under-represented-of-all-the-death-sentences/">View This Article in it&#8217;s Original Form on Jare.Cloud</a>!</p>



<p>With <a href="https://learn.onemonth.com/hacker-noon/">June estimates at 7000+ authors</a>, 69 other Hackernoon contributors might also be a victim of schizophrenia, along with me. This article serves to demonstrate why these people are facing tougher-than-average odds to live to a ripe old age, and how society isn&#8217;t doing them justice in helping or finding a permanent solution.</p>



<h2>Schizophrenia</h2>



<p>Schizophrenia is the psychotic disorder that&#8217;s defined by losing control over your reality. If you start to slip into beliefs or experiences &#8211; auditory, visual &#8211; that others don&#8217;t perceive, you&#8217;re schizophrenic! There&#8217;s other qualifiers to the disorder, like having a certain frequency and total number occurrences of these thoughts &#8211; as well as a lack of other conditions which may otherwise explain these often terrifying and traumatizing thoughts.</p>



<p>What counts as an hallucination or delusion? A hallucination is an effect on your senses that others can&#8217;t perceive. You might see something that isn&#8217;t there, hear something in the distance that only you can hear &#8211; you might even perceive other people perceiving your hallucinations, which is a trap on it&#8217;s own because now your hallucinations are covering your other hallucinations. You can see how easy it would be to lose touch with reality when your own human mind makes up its mind to revolt!</p>



<p>A delusion is a belief in something, some thought or idea or pattern that nobody else can perceive. You might think the media is talking to you, telling you to do things in secret code. You might think that you are somehow special, be it superpowers or the fact that you&#8217;re President &#8211; these delusions can vary in strength and severity, and may even go unnoticed in some for years and years before causing any issues.</p>



<p>There are negative symptoms of schizophrenia, too &#8211; where the positive symptoms are qualities you&#8217;ve gained or acquired from the illness, like hallucinations or delusions &#8211; the negative symptoms are things that you&#8217;ve lost with the new mental state. These could be habits or behaviours like caring about one&#8217;s well-being (cooking, cleaning, self-care) or curtailing one&#8217;s hobbies due to lack of interest.</p>



<h2>Prevalence</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.mentalhelp.net/schizophrenia/statistics/">Schizophrenia affects 1% of the population, 1.5% of Americans and 1.5 million people were diagnosed with it this year.</a> This translates to 300 000 Canadians, nearly 5 million Americans &#8211; verily, 105 million people around the world. Indeed, someone you know &#8211; more than one person you know &#8211; could very well be suffering.</p>



<h2>Concurrent Disorders &amp; Overdoses</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.addictioncenter.com/addiction/schizophrenia/">Nearly half of people suffering from schizophrenia abuse drugs and alcohol</a>. We call this a &#8216;concurrent disorder&#8217; &#8211; meaning that drugs and alcohol abuse are occurring at the same time as the psychological symptoms that lead a professional to diagnose schizophrenia.</p>



<p>I bid you welcome to the first reason schizophrenia is a death sentence: <a href="https://www.drugabuse.gov/related-topics/trends-statistics/overdose-death-rates">0.216% of the American population died from overdoses</a> from 1999-2017 (with a noticeable trend upwards in deaths/year). Given that <a href="https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/nationwide-trends">9.4% of the population reported using illicit drugs</a> in the last month:</p>



<p>Americans: 300 000 000<br>
Drug abusers: 28 200 000 (9.4%)<br>
Deaths / 18 years: 648 000 (0.216%)<br>
Deaths / abusers: 2.3%<br>
Abusers / schizophrenics: 50%<br>
Schizophrenics: 5 000 000 (1.5%)<br>
Abusers that are schizophrenics: 2 500 000 (0.75%)<br>
Deaths / abusers that are schizophrenics: 57 500 (1.15% of # schizophrenic)<br>
Deaths schizophrenics / deaths abusers: 8.88%</p>



<p>8.88/2.3: you are 3.86 times as likely to die from an overdose than the average drug abuser if you&#8217;re schizophrenic.<br> 1.15/0.216: you are 5.32 times as likely to die from an overdose than the average person if you&#8217;re schizophrenic. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-5-1024x543.png" alt="" class="wp-image-194" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-5-1024x543.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-5-300x159.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-5-768x407.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-5.png 1418w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2>Suicides</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj9lIGGiYXnAhXKl-AKHVlcA-kQFjACegQIAxAB&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fafsp.org%2Fabout-suicide%2Fsuicide-statistics%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw2pQbS5wgQ6GOwg_6X9pNYI">suicide rate for Americans is 0.014%</a> when &#8216;adjusted.&#8217;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2951591/">&#8216;lifetime risk of suicide&#8217; for people with schizophrenia is 4.9%</a>.</p>



<p>Americans: 300 000 000<br>
Suicides: 4 200 000 (0.014%)<br>
Suicides / schizophrenics: 4.9%<br>
Schizophrenics: 5 000 000 (1.5%)<br>
Suicides that are schizophrenics: 245 000 (0.08%)</p>



<p>4.9/0.014: you are 350 times as likely to die from suicide than the average person if you&#8217;re schizophrenic.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-6-1024x418.png" alt="" class="wp-image-195" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-6-1024x418.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-6-300x122.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-6-768x313.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-6.png 1064w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>I&#8217;ll let the numbers speak for themselves in this section.</p>



<h2>Smoking Cigarettes</h2>



<p>According to the CDC, <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi2nbLEioXnAhVlmeAKHYs-AM4QFjAAegQIARAB&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Ftobacco%2Fdata_statistics%2Ffact_sheets%2Fadult_data%2Fcig_smoking%2Findex.htm&amp;usg=AOvVaw1lrsmaMLcnUe3I1S6iAF4g">34 000 000 Americans smoke</a>. <a href="http://www.schizophrenia.com/smokereport.htm#">90% of schizophrenics smoke</a>. <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=5&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjIgLz6ioXnAhXSmOAKHUO6CMEQFjAEegQIDBAU&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fnews%2Fwonk%2Fwp%2F2015%2F02%2F26%2Fthe-terrifying-rate-at-which-smokers-die-from-smoking%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw0z4xmvDAkNBTEm8aQAQVMf">67% of smokers die from smoking</a>, 474500 a year. Excuse the changing numbers here, in the previous calculation the 1.5% of schizophrenics was from the stat &#8211; and in this second calculation it&#8217;s divided into my guesstimation of total Americans, so 1.666%.</p>



<p>Americans: 300 000 000<br>
Smokers: 34 000 000 (11.33%)<br>
Smokers that die from smoking: 387600 (0.1292%)<br>
Deaths / smokers: 1.14%<br>
Deaths / population: 2 193 000 (0.731%)<br>
Dead smokers / deaths: 17.67%<br>
Smokers / schizophrenics: 90%<br>
Schizophrenics: 5 000 000 (1.666%)<br>
Smokers that are schizophrenics: 4 500 000 (1.5%)<br>
Smokers that are schizophrenics that die: 63 000 <br>
Deaths schizophrenic smokers: 1.26%</p>



<p>You are 11% more likely to die if you smoke while schizophrenic than the average smoker.<br> You are 1.72x as likely to die in a given year if you smoke while schizophrenic than the  average population.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-7-1024x463.png" alt="" class="wp-image-196" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-7-1024x463.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-7-300x136.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-7-768x347.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-7-1536x694.png 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-7.png 1614w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2>Research</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.hiv.gov/federal-response/funding/budget">0.856 billion is spent on HIV/AIDS efforts a year</a>, affecting <a href="https://www.hiv.gov/hiv-basics/overview/data-and-trends/statistics">1.1 million Americans</a> and <a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/how-many-people-die-from-aids-each-year-49053">26 000 Americans die from HIV/AIDS each year</a>. $<a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/understanding/statistics">147 000 000 000 is spent on cancer research</a> a year and <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/understanding/statistics">609 000 Americans will die from cancer every year</a> &#8211; 38.4% of people will or have had or do have cancer.</p>



<p><a href="http://www.schizophrenia.com/szfacts.htm">$74.65 is spent on research per person diagnosed with schizophrenia</a>, <a href="https://www.hiv.gov/federal-response/funding/budget">$788.70 for HIV/AIDS per person</a> and $1276.04 for cancer per person. </p>



<p>Seems a bit strange, no?</p>

<p>He stared out from behind his eyes wide shut. In front of him, displayed like countless myriad millions television screens laid one next to each other, were the lives of everyone he’d ever lived — partially, completely, not at all or fully.</p>



<p>He focused on one where he was little Jane being picked up and twirled by her dad. In ecstasy, Jane laughed in joy and giggled in fear as she twirled higher and faster. These are the moments she would remember with elation for the rest of her life, years after her father died in a tragic motorbike accident that could have been avoided — years after Jane has her own kids, twirling them with the same gusto every opportunity she’d had.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/591/0*qdoq097kM6cGT8MP.jpg" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Focusing again, James was Ira being raped by four men in a back alley. The pain, anguish, fear and feel of the knife built anxiety and pain, paranoia and shame for a lifetime — never to be forgiven, forgotten, and never to be repaired.</p>



<p>He was the rapists, exacting dominance. Both the shameful and the shameless.</p>



<p>He was the onlooker, too scared to intervene. Coward. Dastardly.</p>



<p>He was the doctor, the father, the stillborn.</p>



<p>James’ eyes shifted and saw 100s more ‘screens,’ 100s more entries into the days, moments, lifetimes of people around the world — billions of people he was doomed to relive the lives of, over and over, backwards and forwards throughout time and back again.</p>



<p>There was no escape.</p>



<p>He is God, having only ever wanted to sacrifice immortality and — as is the only Godly pursuit — die and be forgotten.</p>



<p>He is Jane.</p>



<p>He is Ira.</p>



<p>He will wake up tomorrow and be Josh for a day.</p>



<p>A moment, Alex.</p>



<p>An infinity, Gods long dead and forgotten by history. Contrived and devised, planned and propagated by people — propagated to subjugate, control, extract money and exact dominance — immortal by design, infinite in the eyes of those who can’t plausibly conceive infinity.</p>



<p>Eyes wide shut.</p>



<p>Countless more animals, rocks, alien worlds — dissociation is a scary, scary thing. One loses one’s senses and knowledge of one’s self, one loses one’s memories and sense of humanity. As a rock on Mars, what do we remember of the Holocaust? What do we remember of Christianity? What do we remember of James? As a rock on Neptune, what do we remember of the rock on Mars?</p>



<p>Being God, how could he refute God?</p>



<p>He’d long since felt the panic leave his body. He’d long since laid there, catatonic, wishing for a sanity he remembered in his childhood. Drifting in and out of consciousness, drifting in and out of the conscience of others. He was all of his ex lovers, he was every side of every argument he’d ever had. He was the ultra-rich. He was the ultra-poor. He was puppy, squid, house. Woman, house, fish, bee. Acceleration, deceleration. Up, down.</p>



<p>As his mind entered the all-familiar mantra of dichotomies, a part of him wondered if he were stuck like this — forever lost between perceptions and realities, forever without a name, legacy, or history. A part of him chimed in that this is what happens every time, and like the Beatles said the sun will come out tomorrow.. There will always be another day, another dawn, another lapse of time where he was he and he wasn’t Jane, Ira, or God. These two parts argued — there were other voices that chimed in — the voices argued, and took bets amongst themselves about whether or not this was the last time, the final straw that broke that camel’s back and landed him forever lost. The voices took bets whether or not he would commit suicide today, tomorrow, die by arrow or die by plane engines falling from the sky — the voices argued…</p>



<p>The dichotomies grew louder to keep them from taking over. To keep them at bay: ocean, sky. Arrow, wound. Nothingness, everything. Quantum. Three states. On, off, both and neither. 1, 0,…</p>



<p>Catatonic. Not moving. Not interacting. Fearing the next day, fearing the chances the voices won and saw him off himself with a bottle of bleach. Fearing God’s revenge. Fearing Ira’s rapists. Fearing Jane’s dad’s drunk driver hit-and-run. Panic sets in…</p>



<p>The heart feels on fire, the heart feels as though it’ll give out. The breathing speeds up. The thoughts continue, and the feedback cycle sets in — faster heart, faster breathing, more psychosis, faster heart, faster breathing.. In the past, James had called emergency services fearing the physical symptoms. Now, having learned how his body tricks his mind tricks his body — a tango nobody wants to endure — he endures it. He sits through it. Looking out from eyes wide shut, he’s aware of the room around him behind closed eyes. Open eyes? He can’t tell anymore. They’re shutting and opening, he can see through them when shut. He is infinite. He is God.</p>



<p>He wouldn’t wish this fate on his worst enemies.</p>



<p>He is patient zero.</p>



<p>He wants to start support groups. He wants to help. He wants to educate, lift stigma, teach, and help others find a peace within themselves they can’t find on their own. He wants to be a voice for those without a voice.</p>

<p>He can’t.</p>



<p>He’s disabled.</p>



<p>He’s destroyed — inwardly, outwardly — he lays there each night on the brink of madness and puts on a smile each day for friends and family. He turns to drugs and alcohol to turn down the mantra, turn down the voices, and takes his medication knowing that The Man’s pharmaceutical agenda is to keep his voice from being heard. He’s dangerous. He threatens the status quo.</p>



<p>He’s not alone.</p>



<p>Squelched by the drugs — prescribed and not — he’s silenced by a system that didn’t give him a chance. The trade is a fair one — lose your autonomy for a series of time that goes by without hallucinations or delusions. Keep yourself in the ‘real’ reality, take these pills, we’ve supplied loads of cocaine on the street to keep you in check.</p>



<p>He is your cousin, your son, your friend, your lover.</p>



<p>As much as he’s everyone, everyone is him.</p>
