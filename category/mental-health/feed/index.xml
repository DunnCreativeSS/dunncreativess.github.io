<p>Fomo3D was a dangerous game theory that was then applied, obfuscated, and raked in a sh#tton of cold, hard cash.</p>



<p>Users would sign up for <a href="https://exitscam.me/">https://exitscam.me/</a> and play the game. Their greed would ensure they always spent more than they lost in an auction that Harvard Business School teaches their pupils &#8211; it&#8217;s called a &#8216;War of Attrition.&#8217;</p>



<p>When offered the chance to bid on a $20 bill with $1, people will bid on it. The problem is this: the 2nd highest bid also has to pay whenever the winner is chosen. So, when the bid is $19 and the prize is $20, someone will surely bid to make a dollar. Now, when you&#8217;re the $18 bid you might lose your $18 if you don&#8217;t bid again &#8211; paying $20 for $20. If you win, you&#8217;re down $0. If you don&#8217;t bid, and lose now, you&#8217;re down $18. </p>



<p>What&#8217;s the person with the $19 bid do?</p>



<p>There&#8217;s been documented cases where the bidding reached a walloping $4000 &#8211; in a display of sheer ego. The loser was caught up in the ecstasy of playing the game.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s exactly what Fomo3D did, except the winnings were divvied up in a very smart way that wasn&#8217;t previously available to the general public: using an underlying dividend-paying or burning token (forget which) they cleverly increased the token value or delivered payments for token holders when people played the game.</p>



<p>This caused a huge social effort by token holders &#8211; and game players &#8211; to spread FOMO about the game around the internet. This would bring in new players and &#8211; occasionally &#8211; those who would even win or lose by ego, or win or lose because of the sheer thrill of the game.</p>



<p>Learning all of this tonight for the first time, I did a brief Google on &#8216;dangerous game theory&#8217; and was actually learning about game theory for the first time in my life. Now, this shit is fun. And profitable.</p>



<p>I read about War of Attrition. What a beautiful concept. </p>



<p>The wikipedia article linked to a few other sources: Chicken, another dangerous game theory, has a fancy theory name &#8211; but it&#8217;s still chicken. When one veers off they lose, when both collide they both lose. We&#8217;ll examine opportunities here at a later date, but I also came across another interesting concept.</p>



<p>The prisoner&#8217;s dilemma is that two guys are caught for selling drugs, and both are facing 2 years for sure. The feds think they&#8217;re both involved in a much more serious crime, and tell Prisoner A that he&#8217;ll get 3 years if they both confess &#8211; but if he confesses, and Prisoner B doesn&#8217;t, he&#8217;ll get 1 year and Prisoner B will get 10. Now, if he denies and Prisoner B confesses, then he will get 10 years and Prisoner B will get 1 year.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-25.png" alt="" class="wp-image-242" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-25.png 645w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-25-300x84.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 645px) 100vw, 645px" /></figure>



<p>What the feds don&#8217;t mention is the final outcome: if they both deny, they&#8217;re both faced with 2 years. This is what&#8217;s referred to as the &#8216;globally optimal solution&#8217; &#8211; meaning that if I was able to talk to the other prisoner we might both deny.</p>



<p>What&#8217;s in my best interest, as Prisoner 1?</p>



<p>Well, it looks as though no matter what I do &#8211; without knowing the other party&#8217;s intentions &#8211; confessing is my best option. I either face 1 year &#8211; which is great &#8211; or three years. However, I&#8217;m completely avoiding the possibility that I might get 10 years &#8211; which is the worst-case scenario. Both of us confessing isn&#8217;t the best optimal answer on the board, but it&#8217;s what&#8217;s best without knowing the other party&#8217;s intentions &#8211; we call this the Nash Equilibrium, after famous mathematician John Nash. This is applied extensively to playing poker &#8211; where it applies just as much. </p>



<p>Nash was also one of the most famous schizophrenics, and the subject of the movie A Beautiful Mind. Want to read more about how people with schizophrenia think? <a href="https://jare.cloud/2020/01/14/how-do-people-with-mental-health-illnesses-like-schizophrenia-or-other-psychoses-think/">Check out this article I wrote on psychotic thoughts</a> (from first-hand experience!)</p>



<p>Now, if we flip these numbers to their inverse and do some jiggery pokery, we can come up with a profitable business idea for anyone to rake in huge amounts of capital from tokensales and giving people the opportunity to have fun &#8211; and potentially win big.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-27.png" alt="" class="wp-image-244" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-27.png 658w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-27-300x83.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 658px) 100vw, 658px" /></figure>



<p>Say my risk is that I might lose all of my 2 Ether deposit on betting in this game. The funds are locked in smart contract. If I go with Option 2, there&#8217;s a chance that I could lose my whole balance or there&#8217;s a chance I might get 1.7 of my ether back. OK, good enough.</p>



<p>If I choose Option 1, there&#8217;s a chance I get 1.3 of my Ether back or &#8211; here&#8217;s the kicker &#8211; I might get 2.3 of my ether back (and &#8216;win&#8217;) should Player 2 choose option 2.</p>



<p>Logic would say that a rational person wants their chance at winning, and will always go with Option 1. Whereas, if both players do, then they both lose. Right?</p>



<p>So far this isn&#8217;t very promising as a dangerous game.</p>



<p>However, enter an oraclized call to a random number generator choosing 50/50 either option 1 or option 2, as player 2. Sure, this player would need to put funds up first in order to play &#8211; which might come from project funds or from tokenholders putting up the funds against people that lock up Eth in a contract &#8211; but check this out, here&#8217;s what would happen in Game 1:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-28-1024x154.png" alt="" class="wp-image-245" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-28-1024x154.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-28-300x45.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-28-768x115.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-28-1536x231.png 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-28.png 1750w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Player 1 will always (rationally) choose option 1. The RNG chooses 50/50 options 1 or 2. In green/yellow are the possible outcomes for player 1: they either get 1.3 Ether if they lose, or 2.3 ether if they win. Now, no rational GAMBLER would play these odds &#8211; but, keep listening! There&#8217;s a 50% chance that the pot wins 0.7 Ether, and a 50% chance it loses 0.3 Ether. Fair enough, so averaging out our winnings that&#8217;s 0.2 Ether.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m going to take this Ether and add half to the game pot. The other half I&#8217;m going to use to give value to my game token &#8211; by buy n burn or dividends.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s look what happens in Game 2:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-29-1024x123.png" alt="" class="wp-image-246" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-29-1024x123.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-29-300x36.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-29-768x92.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-29-1536x184.png 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-29.png 1743w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Now we&#8217;re talking, we&#8217;ve sweetened the pot that the Player has a 50/50 chance of winning &#8211; with half the house&#8217;s winnings from each game before that reinvested back into the pot. There&#8217;s a chance they win &#8211; and pot doesn&#8217;t increase, no new token burn or dividends happen. There&#8217;s half a chance they lose again &#8211; and it&#8217;s added to the pot and increases the value of the token.</p>



<p>Etc etc tending towards infinity, the potential winnings for playing the game increase ever so much while they&#8217;re still losing 1/2 the time playing against the evil supercomputer. </p>



<p>3rd game? More money to be won! Eventually, the gambler&#8217;s odds increase enough to be a worthwhile bet no matter what &#8211; and the token&#8217;s value continues to increase with each average result of the game. This creates a frenzy of people spreading news about the game, drawing more and more people and money into the game.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-30-1024x124.png" alt="" class="wp-image-247" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-30-1024x124.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-30-300x36.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-30-768x93.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-30-1536x186.png 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-30.png 1730w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>What does this mean for me, penning this article? Even though I don&#8217;t have a smart contract developer or a budget, at least now I own the Intellectual Property on this new evolution of a Dangerous Game Theory smart contract game. If you are a smart contract developer and would like to team up, let me know! If I&#8217;ve made any critical errors in my math &#8211; it wouldn&#8217;t be the first time! Let me know!</p>



<p>Now that we&#8217;ve talked about having the benefits of those with beautiful minds &#8211; <a href="https://jare.cloud/2020/01/15/why-schizophrenia-is-the-most-under-represented-of-all-the-death-sentences/">let&#8217;s talk about the challenges schizophrenics face</a>, in this article I wrote!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2>#1: You&#8217;ll Always be Pleasantly Surprised</h2>



<p>This is actually a secret my mom taught me over and over again. If you expect the worst possible outcome in any given situation &#8211; love, relationships, family, work &#8211; then whatever does come to pass will certainly be better than your expectations!</p>



<p>In such a way, you&#8217;ll find little joys throughout your day and week. These little joys will create a sense of reward that you might not have had if you were constantly being let down by your own expectations.</p>



<p>Framing your world in a different light can have certain advantages &#8211; for those with very specific minds, you might lose touch with the &#8216;real reality&#8217; and become a concern for your own self&#8217;s well-being. Read an article I wrote on how <a href="https://jare.cloud/2020/01/14/how-do-people-with-mental-health-illnesses-like-schizophrenia-or-other-psychoses-think/">people with schizophrenia and mental health can actually think</a> (from first-hand experience).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/2118/2511788463_03d9281e2e_z.jpg" alt="Image result for pleasant surprise"/></figure>



<h2>#2: Emergency Preparedness Saves Lives</h2>



<p>In a much more literal sense, being prepared for the worst will mean that you create disaster recovery plans &#8211; be they for the zombie apocalypse, should your car die and need repairs you can&#8217;t immediately afford, or if the lights go out for a day or two &#8211; having a plan improves your chances of getting through the scenario measurably. </p>



<p>This is so true that a brief Google search returns many millions islands (results, in Google English Pirate language) for &#8217;emergency preparedness course,&#8217; <a href="https://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/aclk?sa=L&amp;ai=DChcSEwjL39ilpYvnAhVN1sAKHex_BzcYABAAGgJpbQ&amp;ohost=www.google.com&amp;cid=CAESQOD2M1X01icn_Ddsj9d_VtuSw2OJzkWb-hMqPuHbRQdhjHlW1fmxM4R73TFopbDePIk6WevtDEoZfVqZPTnors0&amp;sig=AOD64_0WZlRmA4DrGAF_Av58ZgcPrRp7aA&amp;q=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwixoc2lpYvnAhXFWc0KHTQqBxIQ0Qx6BAgQEAE&amp;adurl=">like this one at a Canadian university</a>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-19-1024x696.png" alt="" class="wp-image-231" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-19-1024x696.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-19-300x204.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-19-768x522.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-19.png 1178w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2>#3: You&#8217;ll Be Ready for Anything</h2>



<p>Hand in hand with being prepared for the worst-case scenario, you&#8217;ll also be ready for all the other scenarios up and down the range of possible outcomes &#8211; from the best possible ones right down to what could potentially be the absolute worst. Because you have considered and somehow either counted or discounted each possible route, you will have a plan for accomplishing things regardless of how fate will twist your arm. </p>



<p>As you get more and more used to this mental exercise, you&#8217;ll notice that your breadth of perception will naturally expand &#8211; as you&#8217;ll be considering more &#8216;twists of fate,&#8217; having added personal experience and the nature of the universe as it tends towards infinity. What I mean to say, rather, is that as the Powers That Be (whatever you subscribe to) throw new and unexpected curveballs your way, your brain will naturally plan for even more possibilities and outcomes. This will expand your mind way better than the hippie in highschool promised you Lysergic Acid Diethylamide ever could have come close to.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e83b3f710949ba6d82614821d6d3f93dd1786b9/0_1020_3125_1875/master/3125.jpg?width=300&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=7fd40712c4db8af6b93a0ab9580243a9" alt="Image result for lsd"/></figure>



<h2>#4: You&#8217;ll Achieve More Goals</h2>



<p>Well, #3 was a bit of a doublethink mindfuck. What does it translate to, practically? Why should it be encouraging, rather than something to be afraid of?</p>



<p>In reality, creating new and interesting ways to approach problems will give you new and novel ways of conquering those problems. Your new disaster emergency preparedness attitude &#8211; when applied to everything &#8211; will allow you to accomplish more and more of your goals, more and more frequently. </p>



<p>This has a fantastic effect on your mindset, and overall happiness. If you do end up doing the things you set out to do more often than you do now, or even in fashions you hadn&#8217;t considered before, then you&#8217;ll have more and more dopamine for your pleasure centers &#8211; which means a happier, healthier you!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://images.saba.com/uploads/blog/what-should-you-do-when-you-dont-accomplish-your-goals/what-should-you-do-when-you-dont-accomplish-your-goals.jpg?s=1696x900" alt="Image result for accomplish"/></figure>



<h2>Bonus: Win Friends and Influence Enemies</h2>



<p>With a happier, healthier you comes a number of bonus effects &#8211; like a boost in charisma, confidence, ability. This truly is a snowball effect of positive outcomes.</p>



<p>When you present yourself better &#8211; or at least, more confidently &#8211; it results in people taking you more seriously, or appreciating you (or at least, your opinions and voice) more and more. This will allow you to gain more traction at work, home, and play. </p>



<p>It will allow you to harness your new-found powers of persuasion in two important ways. First, you&#8217;ll be able to befriend more people more frequently &#8211; winning their approval and allowing them to become proponents of whatever causes or values you subscribe to. Second, you&#8217;ll be able to exert your newfound influence over people who might detract from your causes or values &#8211; allowing you to gain more of a say over the people who would do you ill or harm (even just on the theoretical, intellectual level).</p>



<p>Did I interest you already about the ways in which a segregated, compartmentalized mindset can be a blessing &#8211; and a curse? <a href="https://jare.cloud/2020/01/15/why-schizophrenia-is-the-most-under-represented-of-all-the-death-sentences/">Read my other article here on how schizophrenia increases your chances of an early end to your mortal turmoil</a> (read again: it&#8217;s a fatal diagnosis. No, no joke!)</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Ad%2BUal74L.jpg" alt="Image result for win friends influence people"/></figure>



<h2>Bonus (Voice of Reason!) #2: This Is Actually a Lot of Work</h2>



<p>When you&#8217;re tasking your mind with so much data to consume and analyze, you&#8217;re actually spending a lot more time thinking about yourself and your surroundings, experiences and misconceptions an awful lot more than you are should you not be exercising this theory. This can translate to an awful lot of work &#8211; something that might end up tasking you to a point where it can do more harm than good.</p>



<p>Truly, if you become preoccupied by this exercise and it gets in the way of goals rather than helping them &#8211; or prevents you from performing at work, home, school, or anywhere &#8211; then it might not be worth the time that goes into it. As with anything, it&#8217;s good in moderation &#8211; and we should always exercise a good balance in our own minds.</p>

<p><a href="http://jare.cloud/2020/01/15/why-schizophrenia-is-the-most-under-represented-of-all-the-death-sentences/">View This Article in it&#8217;s Original Form on Jare.Cloud</a>!</p>



<p>With <a href="https://learn.onemonth.com/hacker-noon/">June estimates at 7000+ authors</a>, 69 other Hackernoon contributors might also be a victim of schizophrenia, along with me. This article serves to demonstrate why these people are facing tougher-than-average odds to live to a ripe old age, and how society isn&#8217;t doing them justice in helping or finding a permanent solution.</p>



<h2>Schizophrenia</h2>



<p>Schizophrenia is the psychotic disorder that&#8217;s defined by losing control over your reality. If you start to slip into beliefs or experiences &#8211; auditory, visual &#8211; that others don&#8217;t perceive, you&#8217;re schizophrenic! There&#8217;s other qualifiers to the disorder, like having a certain frequency and total number occurrences of these thoughts &#8211; as well as a lack of other conditions which may otherwise explain these often terrifying and traumatizing thoughts.</p>



<p>What counts as an hallucination or delusion? A hallucination is an effect on your senses that others can&#8217;t perceive. You might see something that isn&#8217;t there, hear something in the distance that only you can hear &#8211; you might even perceive other people perceiving your hallucinations, which is a trap on it&#8217;s own because now your hallucinations are covering your other hallucinations. You can see how easy it would be to lose touch with reality when your own human mind makes up its mind to revolt!</p>



<p>A delusion is a belief in something, some thought or idea or pattern that nobody else can perceive. You might think the media is talking to you, telling you to do things in secret code. You might think that you are somehow special, be it superpowers or the fact that you&#8217;re President &#8211; these delusions can vary in strength and severity, and may even go unnoticed in some for years and years before causing any issues.</p>



<p>There are negative symptoms of schizophrenia, too &#8211; where the positive symptoms are qualities you&#8217;ve gained or acquired from the illness, like hallucinations or delusions &#8211; the negative symptoms are things that you&#8217;ve lost with the new mental state. These could be habits or behaviours like caring about one&#8217;s well-being (cooking, cleaning, self-care) or curtailing one&#8217;s hobbies due to lack of interest.</p>



<h2>Prevalence</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.mentalhelp.net/schizophrenia/statistics/">Schizophrenia affects 1% of the population, 1.5% of Americans and 1.5 million people were diagnosed with it this year.</a> This translates to 300 000 Canadians, nearly 5 million Americans &#8211; verily, 105 million people around the world. Indeed, someone you know &#8211; more than one person you know &#8211; could very well be suffering.</p>



<h2>Concurrent Disorders &amp; Overdoses</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.addictioncenter.com/addiction/schizophrenia/">Nearly half of people suffering from schizophrenia abuse drugs and alcohol</a>. We call this a &#8216;concurrent disorder&#8217; &#8211; meaning that drugs and alcohol abuse are occurring at the same time as the psychological symptoms that lead a professional to diagnose schizophrenia.</p>



<p>I bid you welcome to the first reason schizophrenia is a death sentence: <a href="https://www.drugabuse.gov/related-topics/trends-statistics/overdose-death-rates">0.216% of the American population died from overdoses</a> from 1999-2017 (with a noticeable trend upwards in deaths/year). Given that <a href="https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/nationwide-trends">9.4% of the population reported using illicit drugs</a> in the last month:</p>



<p>Americans: 300 000 000<br>
Drug abusers: 28 200 000 (9.4%)<br>
Deaths / 18 years: 648 000 (0.216%)<br>
Deaths / abusers: 2.3%<br>
Abusers / schizophrenics: 50%<br>
Schizophrenics: 5 000 000 (1.5%)<br>
Abusers that are schizophrenics: 2 500 000 (0.75%)<br>
Deaths / abusers that are schizophrenics: 57 500 (1.15% of # schizophrenic)<br>
Deaths schizophrenics / deaths abusers: 8.88%</p>



<p>8.88/2.3: you are 3.86 times as likely to die from an overdose than the average drug abuser if you&#8217;re schizophrenic.<br> 1.15/0.216: you are 5.32 times as likely to die from an overdose than the average person if you&#8217;re schizophrenic. </p>

<h2>Suicides</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj9lIGGiYXnAhXKl-AKHVlcA-kQFjACegQIAxAB&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fafsp.org%2Fabout-suicide%2Fsuicide-statistics%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw2pQbS5wgQ6GOwg_6X9pNYI">suicide rate for Americans is 0.014%</a> when &#8216;adjusted.&#8217;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2951591/">&#8216;lifetime risk of suicide&#8217; for people with schizophrenia is 4.9%</a>.</p>



<p>Americans: 300 000 000<br>
Suicides: 4 200 000 (0.014%)<br>
Suicides / schizophrenics: 4.9%<br>
Schizophrenics: 5 000 000 (1.5%)<br>
Suicides that are schizophrenics: 245 000 (0.08%)</p>



<p>4.9/0.014: you are 350 times as likely to die from suicide than the average person if you&#8217;re schizophrenic.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-6-1024x418.png" alt="" class="wp-image-195" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-6-1024x418.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-6-300x122.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-6-768x313.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-6.png 1064w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>I&#8217;ll let the numbers speak for themselves in this section.</p>



<h2>Smoking Cigarettes</h2>



<p>According to the CDC, <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi2nbLEioXnAhVlmeAKHYs-AM4QFjAAegQIARAB&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Ftobacco%2Fdata_statistics%2Ffact_sheets%2Fadult_data%2Fcig_smoking%2Findex.htm&amp;usg=AOvVaw1lrsmaMLcnUe3I1S6iAF4g">34 000 000 Americans smoke</a>. <a href="http://www.schizophrenia.com/smokereport.htm#">90% of schizophrenics smoke</a>. <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=5&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjIgLz6ioXnAhXSmOAKHUO6CMEQFjAEegQIDBAU&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fnews%2Fwonk%2Fwp%2F2015%2F02%2F26%2Fthe-terrifying-rate-at-which-smokers-die-from-smoking%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw0z4xmvDAkNBTEm8aQAQVMf">67% of smokers die from smoking</a>, 474500 a year. Excuse the changing numbers here, in the previous calculation the 1.5% of schizophrenics was from the stat &#8211; and in this second calculation it&#8217;s divided into my guesstimation of total Americans, so 1.666%.</p>



<p>Americans: 300 000 000<br>
Smokers: 34 000 000 (11.33%)<br>
Smokers that die from smoking: 387600 (0.1292%)<br>
Deaths / smokers: 1.14%<br>
Deaths / population: 2 193 000 (0.731%)<br>
Dead smokers / deaths: 17.67%<br>
Smokers / schizophrenics: 90%<br>
Schizophrenics: 5 000 000 (1.666%)<br>
Smokers that are schizophrenics: 4 500 000 (1.5%)<br>
Smokers that are schizophrenics that die: 63 000 <br>
Deaths schizophrenic smokers: 1.26%</p>



<p>You are 11% more likely to die if you smoke while schizophrenic than the average smoker.<br> You are 1.72x as likely to die in a given year if you smoke while schizophrenic than the  average population.</p>

<h2>Research</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.hiv.gov/federal-response/funding/budget">0.856 billion is spent on HIV/AIDS efforts a year</a>, affecting <a href="https://www.hiv.gov/hiv-basics/overview/data-and-trends/statistics">1.1 million Americans</a> and <a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/how-many-people-die-from-aids-each-year-49053">26 000 Americans die from HIV/AIDS each year</a>. $<a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/understanding/statistics">147 000 000 000 is spent on cancer research</a> a year and <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/understanding/statistics">609 000 Americans will die from cancer every year</a> &#8211; 38.4% of people will or have had or do have cancer.</p>



<p><a href="http://www.schizophrenia.com/szfacts.htm">$74.65 is spent on research per person diagnosed with schizophrenia</a>, <a href="https://www.hiv.gov/federal-response/funding/budget">$788.70 for HIV/AIDS per person</a> and $1276.04 for cancer per person. </p>



<p>Seems a bit strange, no?</p>

<p>He stared out from behind his eyes wide shut. In front of him, displayed like countless myriad millions television screens laid one next to each other, were the lives of everyone he’d ever lived — partially, completely, not at all or fully.</p>



<p>He focused on one where he was little Jane being picked up and twirled by her dad. In ecstasy, Jane laughed in joy and giggled in fear as she twirled higher and faster. These are the moments she would remember with elation for the rest of her life, years after her father died in a tragic motorbike accident that could have been avoided — years after Jane has her own kids, twirling them with the same gusto every opportunity she’d had.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/591/0*qdoq097kM6cGT8MP.jpg" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Focusing again, James was Ira being raped by four men in a back alley. The pain, anguish, fear and feel of the knife built anxiety and pain, paranoia and shame for a lifetime — never to be forgiven, forgotten, and never to be repaired.</p>



<p>He was the rapists, exacting dominance. Both the shameful and the shameless.</p>



<p>He was the onlooker, too scared to intervene. Coward. Dastardly.</p>



<p>He was the doctor, the father, the stillborn.</p>



<p>James’ eyes shifted and saw 100s more ‘screens,’ 100s more entries into the days, moments, lifetimes of people around the world — billions of people he was doomed to relive the lives of, over and over, backwards and forwards throughout time and back again.</p>



<p>There was no escape.</p>



<p>He is God, having only ever wanted to sacrifice immortality and — as is the only Godly pursuit — die and be forgotten.</p>



<p>He is Jane.</p>



<p>He is Ira.</p>



<p>He will wake up tomorrow and be Josh for a day.</p>



<p>A moment, Alex.</p>



<p>An infinity, Gods long dead and forgotten by history. Contrived and devised, planned and propagated by people — propagated to subjugate, control, extract money and exact dominance — immortal by design, infinite in the eyes of those who can’t plausibly conceive infinity.</p>



<p>Eyes wide shut.</p>



<p>Countless more animals, rocks, alien worlds — dissociation is a scary, scary thing. One loses one’s senses and knowledge of one’s self, one loses one’s memories and sense of humanity. As a rock on Mars, what do we remember of the Holocaust? What do we remember of Christianity? What do we remember of James? As a rock on Neptune, what do we remember of the rock on Mars?</p>



<p>Being God, how could he refute God?</p>



<p>He’d long since felt the panic leave his body. He’d long since laid there, catatonic, wishing for a sanity he remembered in his childhood. Drifting in and out of consciousness, drifting in and out of the conscience of others. He was all of his ex lovers, he was every side of every argument he’d ever had. He was the ultra-rich. He was the ultra-poor. He was puppy, squid, house. Woman, house, fish, bee. Acceleration, deceleration. Up, down.</p>



<p>As his mind entered the all-familiar mantra of dichotomies, a part of him wondered if he were stuck like this — forever lost between perceptions and realities, forever without a name, legacy, or history. A part of him chimed in that this is what happens every time, and like the Beatles said the sun will come out tomorrow.. There will always be another day, another dawn, another lapse of time where he was he and he wasn’t Jane, Ira, or God. These two parts argued — there were other voices that chimed in — the voices argued, and took bets amongst themselves about whether or not this was the last time, the final straw that broke that camel’s back and landed him forever lost. The voices took bets whether or not he would commit suicide today, tomorrow, die by arrow or die by plane engines falling from the sky — the voices argued…</p>



<p>The dichotomies grew louder to keep them from taking over. To keep them at bay: ocean, sky. Arrow, wound. Nothingness, everything. Quantum. Three states. On, off, both and neither. 1, 0,…</p>



<p>Catatonic. Not moving. Not interacting. Fearing the next day, fearing the chances the voices won and saw him off himself with a bottle of bleach. Fearing God’s revenge. Fearing Ira’s rapists. Fearing Jane’s dad’s drunk driver hit-and-run. Panic sets in…</p>



<p>The heart feels on fire, the heart feels as though it’ll give out. The breathing speeds up. The thoughts continue, and the feedback cycle sets in — faster heart, faster breathing, more psychosis, faster heart, faster breathing.. In the past, James had called emergency services fearing the physical symptoms. Now, having learned how his body tricks his mind tricks his body — a tango nobody wants to endure — he endures it. He sits through it. Looking out from eyes wide shut, he’s aware of the room around him behind closed eyes. Open eyes? He can’t tell anymore. They’re shutting and opening, he can see through them when shut. He is infinite. He is God.</p>



<p>He wouldn’t wish this fate on his worst enemies.</p>



<p>He is patient zero.</p>



<p>He wants to start support groups. He wants to help. He wants to educate, lift stigma, teach, and help others find a peace within themselves they can’t find on their own. He wants to be a voice for those without a voice.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/827/0*FUcYxeuEueSWPZ0J" alt=""/></figure>



<p>He can’t.</p>



<p>He’s disabled.</p>



<p>He’s destroyed — inwardly, outwardly — he lays there each night on the brink of madness and puts on a smile each day for friends and family. He turns to drugs and alcohol to turn down the mantra, turn down the voices, and takes his medication knowing that The Man’s pharmaceutical agenda is to keep his voice from being heard. He’s dangerous. He threatens the status quo.</p>



<p>He’s not alone.</p>



<p>Squelched by the drugs — prescribed and not — he’s silenced by a system that didn’t give him a chance. The trade is a fair one — lose your autonomy for a series of time that goes by without hallucinations or delusions. Keep yourself in the ‘real’ reality, take these pills, we’ve supplied loads of cocaine on the street to keep you in check.</p>



<p>He is your cousin, your son, your friend, your lover.</p>



<p>As much as he’s everyone, everyone is him.</p>
