<p><a href="https://www.publish0x.com/?a=olejNWvejN">Sign up for Publish0x and start rewarding your favorite content</a> &#8211; without paying a cent! You also get paid!</p>



<p>As one of my first ads delivered through the Brave browser was for Publish0x, I had originally been quick to dismiss it. On later inspection &#8211; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BATProject/comments/er28xp/i_havent_sent_any_bat_but_theres_a_disconnect/">when I figured out I could 2.5x my BAT rewards by switching my Brave Rewards from 2 ads/hr to 5</a> &#8211; I found I could earn BAT and DAI for blogging&#8230; or reading!&#8230; my favorite content on their platform.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-43.png" alt="" class="wp-image-328" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-43.png 965w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-43-300x160.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-43-768x411.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 965px) 100vw, 965px" /></figure>



<p>This, together with syndication for my blog and juicey backlinks, allowed me to quickly sign up and find that indeed &#8211; I was able to tip every few minutes and choose what % of that tip I wanted to keep for myself.</p>



<p>Win-win-win! The money comes from their big ol&#8217; community chest of possible rewards, spanning many coins.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-44-1024x259.png" alt="" class="wp-image-329" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-44-1024x259.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-44-300x76.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-44-768x195.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-44.png 1042w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-45-1024x164.png" alt="" class="wp-image-330" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-45-1024x164.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-45-300x48.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-45-768x123.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-45-1536x246.png 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-45.png 1567w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>In such a way, I&#8217;ve earned BAT, HYDRO and DAI already on the platform &#8211; by voting on 4 articles. Genius!</p>



<p>This is the definition of redistribution of wealth. The communist&#8217;s dream, in a capitalist application!</p>



<p>Hint: they also sport a fancy Ambassador program &#8211; allowing you, too, &#8216;Earn&nbsp;<strong>5%</strong>&nbsp;of every tip generated by your referrals using the tipper at the bottom of each article. This includes both the tip to the author and the amount claimed by your referral.&#8217;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-46-1024x414.png" alt="" class="wp-image-331" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-46-1024x414.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-46-300x121.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-46-768x310.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-46-1536x621.png 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-46.png 1640w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Check it out! My buddy signed up and tipped a writer.. and I earned, before I even finished this promotional post! That&#8217;s free money begetting free money. I&#8217;m sorry, but you NEED to sign up now! It&#8217;s basically a DAI/BAT/ et cetera faucet for content you&#8217;d enjoy regardless!</p>

<p><a href="https://jare.cloud/2020/01/19/nexo-review-for-crypto-loans-and-bitcoin-loans-and-crypto-cards-mco-visa-tenx-too/">View this article in it’s original form on jare.cloud</a>!</p>



<h2>Intro</h2>



<p>What if Nexo had more than $100m USD worth of YOUR assets? More than their centralized bank-backed insurance fund protects?</p>



<p>What if Nexo began speculatively investing YOUR funds into third-party protocols, putting the capital at risk &#8211; or even losing substantial amounts of it?</p>



<p>What if Nexo, Monaco (MCO) or TenX bailed with all your funds &#8211; in massive exit scams the likes of which we have indeed seen before, at Mt. Gox or QuadrigaCX?</p>



<p>What are the alternatives for collateralized loans &#8211; where can we hedge our crypto assets, using Bitcoin or Ether or other underlyings to draw tax-friendly income? </p>



<p>Read on&#8230;</p>



<h2>Centralized Off-Chain Crypto Interest on Holdings &#8211; and Collateralized Loans Against Crypto &#8211; Seems Like a Great Idea</h2>



<p>While Nexo and Nexo clones offer some great incentives to help you feel safe &amp; secure handing over your hard-earned crypto, like a $100 million insurance fund or tax-friendly income while not spending your assets &#8211; there are huge pitfalls to trusting The Man with your units of value&#8230; with YOUR money.</p>



<p>Sure, someone may be in the position where they hold 1 BTC and want to earn a % of that 1 BTC back from an organization while doing absolutely nothing. Seems risk-free, right? &#8216;Compound your crypto&#8217; is a popular sentiment on the Internet of late &#8211; I even <a href="https://twitter.com/jarettdunn">use that phrase in my twitter bio</a>. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-34.png" alt="" class="wp-image-306" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-34.png 996w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-34-300x78.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-34-768x200.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 996px) 100vw, 996px" /></figure>



<p>What does it mean, in actual effect?</p>



<p>Well, if I have 1 BTC now and that BTC earns me 8% APR &#8211; each and every year &#8211; that 8% will earn another 8% on the 8% in year 2. </p>



<p>If we&#8217;re also long BTC, or think it&#8217;ll grow at, say, 5% average per year in value, then our resulting investment would look like this:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-35-1024x303.png" alt="" class="wp-image-307" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-35-1024x303.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-35-300x89.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-35-768x227.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-35.png 1377w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>After 10 years your BTC has nearly doubled, and the value of that BTC is up 112x&#8230;.</p>



<p>That seems to be fantastic, right? And a 5% growth on BTC per year is rather.. well, conservative, right?</p>



<h2>Other Side of That Coin</h2>



<p>Say we&#8217;re even more long on a bullish BTC, and think it&#8217;ll rise in value by &#8211; say &#8211; 30% per year. Now, we can look at Nexo or other centralized bank-backed solutions to lend US Dollar against our asset. I&#8217;m risk averse to clicking on their site, but I imagine their rates are maybe 10-14% APR. So, we lend the max. amount against our BTC at around $4500 USD, and pay 14% on the loan &#8211; while our BTC appreciates 30%.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s what that math looks like:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-36-1024x334.png" alt="" class="wp-image-308" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-36-1024x334.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-36-300x98.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-36-768x250.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-36.png 1313w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>All else remaining equal, shortly after 6 years we have ALL of our bitcoin back in appreciated value vs what we owe on our loan. </p>



<p>Let&#8217;s go even more bullish BTC &#8211; think The Halvening will grow BTC to $12k, then it&#8217;s a clear road to $20k, then moon? So do I!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-37-1024x334.png" alt="" class="wp-image-309" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-37-1024x334.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-37-300x98.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-37-768x250.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-37.png 1313w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>If BTC grows 230% in a calendar year, we effectively have a free half BTC in loaned amount in less than a year. That&#8217;s fantastic! Free money!</p>



<h2>Now, the Catch</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-38.png" alt="" class="wp-image-310" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-38.png 728w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-38-300x84.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /></figure>



<p>I wonder if Nexo has overgrown their little insurance scheme? I wonder if too many people have trusted something too good to be true &#8211; in the hands of a select few, a legal entity, and human fallacies?</p>



<p>Even more sinister, let&#8217;s say Nexo was sitting on millions of dollars in Ether. Let&#8217;s say they thought &#8211; nay, they bet on the idea &#8211; that Ether would never ever possibly depreciate past $300. Long Live Ether, right? Now, they use a third party protocol to lend against their Ether bankroll &#8211; to the tune of millions $ USD &#8211; to boost their coffers and all their marketing campaigns to draw more people into their massive &#8216;insured&#8217; ponzi. </p>



<p>Then, as we witnessed, Eth did go down. Way. Past. $300.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-39-1024x473.png" alt="" class="wp-image-311" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-39-1024x473.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-39-300x139.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-39-768x355.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-39.png 1343w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-40-1024x627.png" alt="" class="wp-image-312" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-40-1024x627.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-40-300x184.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-40-768x470.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-40.png 1077w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-41.png" alt="" class="wp-image-313" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-41.png 916w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-41-300x216.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-41-768x552.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 916px) 100vw, 916px" /></figure>



<p>Can you think of anything more sinister&#8230; than risking people&#8217;s funds they trust your insurance to cover, then losing it? </p>



<p>Trust the banks to mess with you like this.</p>



<p>Trust custodial solutions to mess with your hard-earned cash.</p>



<h2>Monaco&#8217;s Visa Card, TenX, Populous, and the Others</h2>



<p>Nexo has another product in the pipes: a crypto-loans backed credit/debit card. When you put your crypto onto a debit/credit card, you&#8217;re actually just giving it to banks to hold onto &#8211; and with that, you&#8217;re giving them all of your personally identifiable information, as well as the right to track you and sell your data to the highest bidder (and all the other bidders with half a dollar). What this means is that you&#8217;re taking the ultimate grassroots revolution against banks and the richest 1% and giving it right back to them. This goes against everything Satoshi and all the other crypto revolutionaries had wanted with their digital cash. Do Your Own Research, and decide what&#8217;s right.</p>



<p>Moreover, existing crypto card solutions like cryptopay.me and xapo all lost their licenses for dealing with North America and loads of other places &#8211; because banks, by and large, don&#8217;t trust crypto. </p>



<p>If you need to spend your crypto look to solutions like localbitcoins.com &#8211; where you can even sell your BTC at around 1% on the dollar value to meet in person and get cold, hard cash.</p>



<h2>The Solution</h2>



<p>Never, ever trust custodial solutions! There&#8217;s such a thing as counter-party risk that&#8217;s well documented, and this is why decentralized exchanges and decentralized finance are winning with a clear advantage &#8211; employing trustless solutions where people are interacting with a tech protocol rather than an organization, person, people, or &#8211; worse yet &#8211; a bank.</p>



<p>Solutions are abound: check <a href="https://jare.cloud/2020/01/14/top-money-making-decentralized-finance-defi-applications/">my article comparing the top 6-8 decentralized finance protocols</a>.</p>



<p>Of these, a few come to mind for compounding your crypto: like <a href="https://compound.finance/">compound.finance</a>, where you can earn interest on your cryptos while holding them in your own damned wallet, secured by your own damned keys. This completely removes the counter-party risk of earning on your crypto. Almost all the other solutions in the above article like <a href="http://nuo.network/">nuo.network</a> or <a href="http://fulcrum.trade/">fulcrum.trade</a> allow you to earn, too, sometimes at higher rates &#8211; and aggregators exist, too, like <a href="http://staked.us/?pid=fr5BC09Vgc">staked.us&#8217;s Robo Advisor for Yield</a> which allows you to passively rebalance your lent portfolio.</p>



<p>Compound also allows you to borrow against your crypto assets &#8211; all on-chain, all non-custodial. You own your own keys. You can receive a number of stablecoins for your Ether or other tokens, or even borrow against non-stable assets &#8211; the choice is yours to long or short whatever you like. </p>



<p>They currently don&#8217;t support borrowing against BTC or the BTC-backed Wrapped BTC (WBTC), but have no fear! Fulcrum.trade has a sister-site powered by the same protocol <a href="https://torque.loans/">https://torque.loans/</a>  where &#8211; at present &#8211; you can get $4800 in stablecoins for your 1 WBTC.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-42.png" alt="" class="wp-image-314" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-42.png 821w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-42-300x232.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-42-768x593.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 821px) 100vw, 821px" /></figure>



<h2>The Verdict</h2>



<p>Never, ever trust The Man with your money. That&#8217;s the point of Blockchain. Banks, governments will collapse and fail, the ATMs will stop giving you money and gas will stop being delivered to your favorite gas stations &#8211; food will stop being delivered to your supermarkets &#8211; but crypto will not fail because the protocols are run without the interference or governance of man (or woman, or other).</p>



<p>Tired of The Man earning from your browsing habits, personally identifiable information and by selling your data? Try the <a href="https://jare.cloud/2020/01/15/better-web-brave-rewards-your-content-make-money-monetizing-twitter/">Brave browser, which not only protects all of your data and privacy,</a> but also axes all those damaging ads around the web &#8211; delivering you a faster, safer browsing experience!</p>

<p>Folks welcome to Web 3.0.</p>



<p>Not only does Brave pay me in $BAT for browsing the internet by serving me ads I enjoy watching based on my interests, it literally allows people to tip and automatically contribute to those Twitter users using Brave. </p>



<p>It also allows me to monetize my YouTube &#8211; I have 344 viewers watching my old ass YouTubes for 9.5hrs/month. I can now monetize some of those…</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-14-1024x410.png" alt="" class="wp-image-214" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-14-1024x410.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-14-300x120.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-14-768x308.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-14.png 1231w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Admittedly, my one true passion is finding a way to create evergreen and passive income for myself &#8211; now people viewing my YouTube videos will automagically share some of their $BAT with me. People that like me even more might opt to share more %, or even tip me one-time or repeatedly&#8230;.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve been aware of BAT as a project and Brave as a browser for a long, long time, being a crypto enthusiast all these years. I resisted doing a tiny 5-second Google search because I assumed it was a new-fangled low-functioning browser that would disappoint. I wasn&#8217;t aware it&#8217;s literally built on chrome, can import my bookmarks and I can use all my favorite extensions!</p>

<p>On top of all that, it&#8217;s actively blocking unwanted ads across sites and ad networks while also keeping my private browsing information like cookie data or personally identifiable information from being transmitted from my machine.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-16-1024x682.png" alt="" class="wp-image-216" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-16-1024x682.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-16-300x200.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-16-768x512.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-16-120x80.png 120w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-16.png 1031w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>As <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/31/personal-data-corporate-use-google-amazon">an article on theguardian quotes</a>: &#8216;Data appropriation is a form of exploitation because companies use data to create value without providing people with comparable compensation.&#8217;</p>



<p>What&#8217;s the solution? Limit the data you send! Be compensated for the data you do choose to share!</p>



<p>Within a few seconds of having the browser opened, I&#8217;d already earned a penny as they showed me an ad from BlockFi.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-17-1024x629.png" alt="" class="wp-image-217" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-17-1024x629.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-17-300x184.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-17-768x472.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-17.png 1083w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Another ad, advertising BAT&#8217;s community forums, turned out to be incredibly informative: as it turns out, the content creators signup page had more options than just Website, Twitch, YouTube. I had connected all three of these already but on the community forum I found a <a href="https://forum.batcommunity.org/t/use-twitter-to-receive-brave-rewards/5987/12">thread talking about tipping people on Twitter</a> &#8211; I thought: I must have this.</p>



<p>On further clicking I found Brave had loads more options for me to earn as a content creator! It&#8217;s probably just my desktop settings &#8211; at 175% zoom because I&#8217;m blind! </p>



<p>Also, in the interface of their Chrome-based browser, they&#8217;ve very cleverly integrated a &#8216;tip&#8217; button on Twitter tweets &#8211; right there in the UI.  </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-18-1024x663.png" alt="" class="wp-image-218" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-18-1024x663.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-18-300x194.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-18-768x497.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-18-850x550.png 850w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-18.png 1037w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>When I visit a content creator of any kind &#8211; including Github profiles, where I receive 100s more evergreen, passive views than I do on YouTube or even your reddit profile which might be (pardon the pun) more prolific than your Twitter &#8211; they&#8217;re automagically added to my pool of content creators that I&#8217;m going to automagically share some tokens with at the end of the month. I get to set totals, %s for each creator, and every other granular little detail.</p>



<p>Essentially, Brave gives the advertising revenue to the end-user who then chooses which publishers they want to reward with how much tokens &#8211; and they get to up the ante for those publishers they&#8217;re truly fans of. It&#8217;s a brilliant idea!</p>
