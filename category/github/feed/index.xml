<p>What&#8217;s all the fuss about?  <a href="https://brave.com/jar444">Download the Brave browser on your computer or mobile</a> phone and start earning now!</p>

<p>Folks welcome to Web 3.0.</p>



<p>Not only does Brave pay me in $BAT for browsing the internet by serving me ads I enjoy watching based on my interests, it literally allows people to tip and automatically contribute to those Twitter users using Brave. </p>



<p>It also allows me to monetize my YouTube &#8211; I have 344 viewers watching my old ass YouTubes for 9.5hrs/month. I can now monetize some of thoseâ€¦</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-14-1024x410.png" alt="" class="wp-image-214" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-14-1024x410.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-14-300x120.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-14-768x308.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-14.png 1231w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Admittedly, my one true passion is finding a way to create evergreen and passive income for myself &#8211; now people viewing my YouTube videos will automagically share some of their $BAT with me. People that like me even more might opt to share more %, or even tip me one-time or repeatedly&#8230;.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve been aware of BAT as a project and Brave as a browser for a long, long time, being a crypto enthusiast all these years. I resisted doing a tiny 5-second Google search because I assumed it was a new-fangled low-functioning browser that would disappoint. I wasn&#8217;t aware it&#8217;s literally built on chrome, can import my bookmarks and I can use all my favorite extensions!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-15-1024x518.png" alt="" class="wp-image-215" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-15-1024x518.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-15-300x152.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-15-768x389.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-15-1536x777.png 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-15.png 1804w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>On top of all that, it&#8217;s actively blocking unwanted ads across sites and ad networks while also keeping my private browsing information like cookie data or personally identifiable information from being transmitted from my machine.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-16-1024x682.png" alt="" class="wp-image-216" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-16-1024x682.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-16-300x200.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-16-768x512.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-16-120x80.png 120w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-16.png 1031w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>As <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/31/personal-data-corporate-use-google-amazon">an article on theguardian quotes</a>: &#8216;Data appropriation is a form of exploitation because companies use data to create value without providing people with comparable compensation.&#8217;</p>



<p>What&#8217;s the solution? Limit the data you send! Be compensated for the data you do choose to share!</p>



<p>Within a few seconds of having the browser opened, I&#8217;d already earned a penny as they showed me an ad from BlockFi.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-17-1024x629.png" alt="" class="wp-image-217" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-17-1024x629.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-17-300x184.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-17-768x472.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-17.png 1083w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Another ad, advertising BAT&#8217;s community forums, turned out to be incredibly informative: as it turns out, the content creators signup page had more options than just Website, Twitch, YouTube. I had connected all three of these already but on the community forum I found a <a href="https://forum.batcommunity.org/t/use-twitter-to-receive-brave-rewards/5987/12">thread talking about tipping people on Twitter</a> &#8211; I thought: I must have this.</p>



<p>On further clicking I found Brave had loads more options for me to earn as a content creator! It&#8217;s probably just my desktop settings &#8211; at 175% zoom because I&#8217;m blind! </p>



<p>Also, in the interface of their Chrome-based browser, they&#8217;ve very cleverly integrated a &#8216;tip&#8217; button on Twitter tweets &#8211; right there in the UI.  </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-18-1024x663.png" alt="" class="wp-image-218" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-18-1024x663.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-18-300x194.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-18-768x497.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-18-850x550.png 850w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-18.png 1037w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>When I visit a content creator of any kind &#8211; including Github profiles, where I receive 100s more evergreen, passive views than I do on YouTube or even your reddit profile which might be (pardon the pun) more prolific than your Twitter &#8211; they&#8217;re automagically added to my pool of content creators that I&#8217;m going to automagically share some tokens with at the end of the month. I get to set totals, %s for each creator, and every other granular little detail.</p>



<p>Essentially, Brave gives the advertising revenue to the end-user who then chooses which publishers they want to reward with how much tokens &#8211; and they get to up the ante for those publishers they&#8217;re truly fans of. It&#8217;s a brilliant idea!</p>

<h2>Strategy</h2>



<ol><li>We follow Twitter accounts we trust: exchanges, coins, Twitter crypto influencers</li><li>We wait around until someone tweets a coin name or coin ticker</li><li>We measure the sentiment of the message: is it buy or sell?</li><li>On strong buys, or multiple instances of buys in a period of time, we execute a market buy order on Binance Spot</li><li>We wait around until our exits are hit</li><li>1 out of every 3-4 signals we act on the crowd will also act on&#8230; </li><li>&#8230;meaning there&#8217;s upwards potential for everyone</li><li>and we can net 100s 1000s% gains!</li></ol>



<p>In practice:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-10.png" alt="" class="wp-image-205" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-10.png 862w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-10-300x289.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-10-768x739.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 862px) 100vw, 862px" /><figcaption> <br></figcaption></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/666371834102677565/667093503817547794/tempFileForShare_20200115-205117.jpg?width=340&amp;height=659" alt=""/></figure>



<h2>NLTK &amp; New Words</h2>



<p>The Python programming language has a package called Natural Language Tool Kit, or NLTK. Inside NLTK are lexicons that you can use to accomplish different goals &#8211; in our project, the Vader Lexicon is useful because we can rank all sorts of English words on a scale of -1 to 1 based on how strongly they express good or bad emotions. This is called &#8216;sentiment analysis.&#8217;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-8.png" alt="" class="wp-image-203" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-8.png 451w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-8-300x199.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-8-120x80.png 120w" sizes="(max-width: 451px) 100vw, 451px" /></figure>



<p>We add some new words to the mix.. given our very specific scenario.</p>



<h2>Weighted Twitter Accounts and Tiers</h2>



<p>Of the accounts in our followed list, we&#8217;ll have exchanges, coins and crypto influencers. Of these, exchanges have the highest amount of influence when they make an announcement about an alt, the coins themselves have a medium amount and the influencers have a variable but usually less amount.</p>



<p>We organize each account we follow (or simply have in a static list) into a list with corresponding ratios for how they affect our sentiment scores. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-9.png" alt="" class="wp-image-204" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-9.png 304w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-9-300x128.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 304px) 100vw, 304px" /></figure>



<h2>Parsing and Referencing All the Binance Spot Coins</h2>



<p>Here&#8217;s what Binance&#8217;s 24hr ticker endpoint looks like:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-11.png" alt="" class="wp-image-206" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-11.png 649w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-11-217x300.png 217w" sizes="(max-width: 649px) 100vw, 649px" /></figure>



<p>We loop through all these results, look for ones that end in BTC and then replace the BTC out of the symbol string &#8211; leaving the coin. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-12-1024x172.png" alt="" class="wp-image-207" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-12-1024x172.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-12-300x50.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-12-768x129.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-12-1536x258.png 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-12.png 1890w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>We now have a list of coins!</p>



<h2>Get Twitter Followed, 100 Recent Tweets Within Last Hour</h2>



<p>This is optional and I may replace the followed list with a flat and static file or coded list, but presently the bot will read the followed list and then loop through it, grabbing everyone&#8217;s 100 most recent tweets (and and/or and not retweets &#8211; optional) and then cycle through those to see which occurred in the last (given timeframe). These are the goldmoney&#8230; we save tweets we&#8217;ve previously indexed to an array so as to not re-index them.</p>



<h2>Find Potential Coinnames, Compare to Our Binance List and Tweeter List</h2>



<p>We split the text of the tweets up by &#8216; &#8216; (space) and &#8216;\n&#8217; (newline). We then look at each resulting word or hashtag, capitalize them and compare them (or $ + the word, like $MANA or $mana or mana or Mana) against our list of tickers from the Binance API. We also then compare against a list of tickers that correspond to specific Twitter accounts, in the event of something like the MANA tweet above that didn&#8217;t mention &#8216;MANA.&#8217; So we can tell that decentraland tweets are, usually, unless otherwise specified, for MANA.</p>



<h2>For High Sentiment Scores, Buy</h2>



<p>On Binance we market buy with a % of our holdings. The % is configurable, and depends on someone&#8217;s aversion to risk.</p>



<h2>For Repeat Occurrences, Buy Again</h2>



<p>If another one of our trusted tweeters tweets another signal confirming the same trend, we &#8216;double down&#8217; and buy another % of remaining balance worth of the coin.</p>



<h2>1% Trailing Take Profit</h2>



<p>If the price immediately drops 1%, we gracefully exit as a stoploss and count our losses. If the price goes up 2% and then down 1%, we exit the trade at 1% gains less fees. If, however, the coin goes up 10% 40% 100% before dropping 1% &#8211; as it might do with mass hysteria &#8211; then we laugh all the way to the bank! 1%, of course, is configurable.</p>



<h2>Rinse, Wash, Repeat</h2>



<p>Another signal another coin another potential 100%!</p>



<h2>Considerations</h2>



<p>We want to use a custom list of crypto influencers because most of the people calling out signals on twitter are actually doing so in their own vested interest &#8211; having posted a buy signal in their private Pump &amp; Dump discords, their private group buys up the coin and then &#8211; 5 minutes later &#8211; they all post signals to their twitters and bought &#8216;influencer&#8217; twitters as tweets that seem to double, triply, quadruply confirm each other. In reality, these folks are dumping by the time anyone else starts to buy in &#8211; meaning that you&#8217;d likely face losses if you used a twitter-wide sentiment analysis and automated trading tool. This is where all existing tools &#8211; including AI-driven ones &#8211; fail in this space, and why my bot has a considerable edge on the competition.</p>



<h2>Next Steps</h2>



<p>I&#8217;d like the bot to keep track of the win/lose rate and severity of wins/losses from specific tweeters, so that it can potentially modify the sentiment score by a previous success factor &#8211; so if someone was right about a buy signal 2/5 times it&#8217;s worth more than someone with 1/5 times. If someone is right 1/10 times, though, and their signal does 25x better than the first two in these examples &#8211; that one is worth considerably more.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-13-1024x629.png" alt="" class="wp-image-208" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-13-1024x629.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-13-300x184.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-13-768x471.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-13.png 1471w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>It&#8217;d be nice to incorporate a python django webserver like a hackathon starter so I can take advantage of their Twitter oauth2 sign-in scheme. This way I can potentially have accounts log in without supplying their own twitter API credentials &#8211; which require an application process now &#8211; and more accounts can work with my bot. This would increase the amount of actionable data and win/loss rates and severities that can be used to package tailored lists of tweeters to know.</p>

<h1 id="cfa9">Preface</h1>



<p>Today weâ€™ll discuss some of the top Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications that exist, serving people in a trustless manner around the world.</p>



<p>What do I mean by trustless? Given Etherâ€™s immutable (cannot change) smart contracts, the behavior of the money moved around DeFi is such that it cannot be stolen, hacked, lost or misappropriated. Moreover, to earn the word â€˜trustless,â€™ I donâ€™t have to put my trust into a given person or organization â€” instead, I trust the underlying technology of the contracts theyâ€™ve devised. Itâ€™s trustless!</p>



<p>Iâ€™ve separated the following doc into four sections, comparing the platforms in each: Trading, Borrowing, WBTC Borrowing, and Lending.</p>



<h1 id="f070">Trading</h1>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image.png" alt="" class="wp-image-180" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image.png 892w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-300x139.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-768x356.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 892px) 100vw, 892px" /></figure>



<p>With up to 5x leverage available to traders, dydxprotocol at&nbsp;<a href="http://dydx.exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dydx.exchange</a>&nbsp;and folks like&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/u/b3d17ffd3219?source=post_page-----75a757dc6408----------------------" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Antonio Juliano</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/u/67f0a6970a7c?source=post_page-----75a757dc6408----------------------" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zhuoxun Yin</a>&nbsp;bring you a beautiful night-mode interface that allows you to trade some of your favorite assets. Some people â€” especially those burned by Mt. Gox or other exit scams â€” are risk-averse to what we call â€˜counterparty risk.â€™ What this means is that some people would much rather have less single points of failure when it comes to the custody of their money â€” and now we can even trade with leverage on platforms like dydx, so who needs centralized exchanges and their bankster owners?</p>



<p>Dydx lets you borrow, too, but weâ€™ll discuss that more in detail in a future section of this article.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1358/1*b6kUKIB8rLIy9QBa_KE7hw.png" alt=""/></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1264/1*Bb6NKV_XMMXdEZkAw1_cfQ.png" alt=""/></figure>



<p>I do like how the people at&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://fulcrum.trade/" target="_blank">fulcrum.trade</a>&nbsp;(their parent org: bZx) separated their trading interface from their borrowing interface. Weâ€™ll have a closer look at their not-for-margin-trading borrowing interface in a later section, but the fulcrum.trade interface lacks some of the leverage available to dydx â€” although that negative is helped by having a broader selection of coins.</p>



<h1 id="2015">Borrowing</h1>



<p>With a resounding set of achieved milestones and growth,&nbsp;<a href="http://compound.finance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">compound.finance</a>&nbsp;and some of the team&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/u/54f6f223cd12?source=post_page-----75a757dc6408----------------------" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Robert Leshner</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/u/8808a762900f?source=post_page-----75a757dc6408----------------------" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Calvin Liu</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/u/42c8b7010550?source=post_page-----75a757dc6408----------------------" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jayson Hobby</a>&nbsp;have been building another Ether unicorn to add to our growing list.</p>



<p>With millions under management, and a wide variety of coins to choose from to use as collateral, Compound provides a unique opportunity in traditional financial history. Itâ€™s apparent that we can over-collateralize loans in crypto against stablecoins and be long those cryptos while getting spending money for the time being â€” the bullish attitude we have towards these cryptos says that their underlying growth in equity value will outperform the interest rates weâ€™re paying on our stablecoin loans. Boom, weâ€™ve just earned â€˜free-ishâ€™ crypto!</p>



<p>Wait, though, this really only applies to Ether and the Ethereum tokens listed on Compound At Time of Writing, and doesnâ€™t appear to apply to WBTC? I really had hoped to diversify my collateral Iâ€™m holding to maximize the upwards potential of both DeFi and The King of Coins, $BTC!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2019/1*ar7ch_ZSKslofPWRdvGJQg.png" alt=""/></figure>



<p>(See, a â€˜Collateral Factorâ€™ of 0% means we canâ€™t use Wrapped BTC as a collateral coin).</p>



<p>Whatever are we to do?</p>



<h1 id="1990">Borrowing Against WBTC</h1>



<p>Like Iâ€™d mentioned above,&nbsp;<a href="http://bzx.network/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bzx.network</a>&nbsp;has the tools&nbsp;<a href="http://fulcrum.trade/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fulcrum.trade</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://torque.loans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">torque.loans</a>, and some of the people working wonders like&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/u/e65fe39afe1d?source=post_page-----75a757dc6408----------------------" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nick Sawinyh</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/u/7c5899852965?source=post_page-----75a757dc6408----------------------" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kyle J Kistner</a>&nbsp;or their team account here&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/u/c84b634c7ca3?source=post_page-----75a757dc6408----------------------" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bZx Team</a>. We discussed fulcrum.trade above and hinted at the existence of torque.loans â€” as a flipside of the same coin, instead of lending and borrowing under-collateralized loans for the purpose of margin trading (a la dydx) we can lend and borrow over-collateralized loans for the purpose of hedging, or whatever other purpose you had in mind (a la compound)!</p>



<p>Simply load up your MetaMask or other wallet, select the token to receive, change your collateral to WBTC and â€” oh, spoke too soon! Found an error among all tokens when selecting WBTC as collateral.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2489/1*7FQA5lzB_AAtgsnIVkEJsg.png" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Wonder if thereâ€™s a bug bountyâ€¦</p>



<p><em>Soon</em>! Youâ€™ll be able to achieve all that diversification and goodness I was speaking about earlier.</p>



<p>EDIT: 15 minutes after my Tweet to bZx and everyone else, at some ungodly hour in the morning that it is right now:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*APv0pSO6xIE8ozzlL9sNvA.png" alt=""/></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1134/1*AGRk-fkbzxjZQ2RZ7dhrsw.png" alt=""/></figure>



<p>When was the last time your banks answered the phone that quick?</p>



<p>EDIT AGAIN: It looks as though the bug was on my side, and itâ€™s working fine now that Iâ€™ve restarted my machine trying to take a screencast for their team â€” all is good in the hood, and likely no cause for alarm! Iâ€™m going to leave this little diversion in here about the bug-that-could-have-been, because it illustrats how prompt, friendly and helpful bZxâ€™s team are.</p>

<h1 id="85de">Lending</h1>



<p>What do diversified assets and Albert Einstein have in common?</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1181/1*KlOBylBk6AmLAj9PNKQO1w.png" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Einstein knew that being on the winning side of compound interest would free people â€” and diversifying your portfolio is step #1 to earning consistent returns. All our moms (or indeed dads, or indeed people-y people) told us â€˜donâ€™t put all your eggs in one basket,â€™ right?</p>



<p>Hereâ€™s where stuff gets interesting. Because the three solutions noted above are all open-source and allow and encourage people to develop tools to add to their utility,&nbsp;<a href="http://staked.us/?pid=fr5BC09Vgc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">staked.us</a>&nbsp;of course at&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/u/2e226f754735?source=post_page-----75a757dc6408----------------------" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Staked</a>&nbsp;developed their tool&nbsp;<a href="https://staked.us/v/robo-advisor-yield/?pid=fr5BC09Vgc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Robo Advisor for Yield</a>. Edit: Shoutout to their man&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/u/94138e7bc2b8?source=post_page-----75a757dc6408----------------------" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Devan Purhar</a>, who handles all my support tickets Iâ€™ve had on their GitHub (one example link and ensuing conversation to follow). Much appreciated!</p>



<p>Whatâ€™s it do?</p>



<p>At present, it indexes Compound, dydx, and fulcrum.trade and gives you the best rate among each of them â€” meaning that if you were to have Robo Advisors for Eth, USDC, DAI and SAI, youâ€™d be earning the best yields for four different assets (one might moon! And: eth staking, coming soon!) â€” maybe more different assets in the future:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/Stakedllc/robo-advisor-yield/issues/5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://github.com/Stakedllc/robo-advisor-yield/issues/5</a>&nbsp;at any given point.</p>



<p>Theyâ€™ve used on-chain, open-source solutions in the keeping with crypto spirit and in order to bolster the offerings of the participant protocols. This means that they add a layer to the tech without adding a party to be considered when thinking about counterparty risk â€” the trust is still in the tech (which has all been thoroughly audited, be sure)!</p>



<h1 id="050e">Conclusion</h1>



<p>So head on over to&nbsp;<a href="http://staked.us/?pid=fr5BC09Vgc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">staked.us</a>, check out their platform where you can earn returns on staking PoS coins, but more importantly check out their&nbsp;<a href="https://staked.us/v/robo-advisor-yield/?pid=fr5BC09Vgc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Robo Advisor for Yield</a>&nbsp;today. You can mint your own RAYs and begin the journey to doubling your crypto, too!</p>



<p>Looking to trade undercollateralized loans, on the blockchain and without a third party? Check out some of the other solutions, like dydx.exchange and fulcrum.trade.</p>



<p>Looking to borrow funds against your crypto? Iâ€™d recommend compound.finance or torque.loans.</p>



<p>DeFi is here to stay â€” banking the unbanked â€” let the games commence!</p>



<h1 id="0d3a">Bonus 1: Nuo.Network</h1>



<p>Nuo.network (with an encouring team including team account&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/u/d834ca07a5ac?source=post_page-----75a757dc6408----------------------" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nuo Network</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/u/29f0b8f49104?source=post_page-----75a757dc6408----------------------" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Varun Deshpande</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/u/2e63d860a40d?source=post_page-----75a757dc6408----------------------" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Siddharth Verma</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/u/a48f2610a12d?source=post_page-----75a757dc6408----------------------" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Praneet Sinha</a>&nbsp;allows you to lend and borrow â€” including WBTC â€” and margin trade using non-custodial addresses, like the other contenders in this list.</p>



<p>Why didnâ€™t Nuo make the original list?</p>



<p>Their smart contracts arenâ€™t public â€” meaning that&nbsp;the interface to build on nuo.network is controlled by their team, and doesnâ€™t allow folks to create additional value by plugging pieces together and offering something brand new â€” like&nbsp;<a href="https://staked.us/v/robo-advisor-yield/?pid=fr5BC09Vgc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">staked.usâ€™s Robo Advisor for Yield</a>&nbsp;does.</p>



<p>However, the Staked team reassures us that theyâ€™ve been in touch with Nuoâ€™s and that â€” pending an upcoming update â€” the code will be public and the joys of Nuo can be introduced into the Robo Advisor for Yield.</p>



<p>Check more details on this post I made outlining Nuo as a possible way to earn yield (and earn yield on WBTC) on Stakedâ€™s RAY:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/Stakedllc/robo-advisor-yield/issues/5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://github.com/Stakedllc/robo-advisor-yield/issues/5</a></p>



<h1 id="3258">Bonus 2: Uniswap</h1>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1389/1*h9q1b-UntQQAeNW0MQfWMw.png" alt=""/></figure>



<p>People like&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/u/5b6f44a990f8?source=post_page-----75a757dc6408----------------------" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Callil Capuozzo</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/u/ec7001b3c11f?source=post_page-----75a757dc6408----------------------" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hayden Adams</a>&nbsp;have been building Uniswap: Heralded as Ethereumâ€™s unicorn â€” Uniswap allows a whole bunch of interesting features. These include swapping Ether tokens and paying a small fee all the way up to submitting your own new exchange (token) to the network and having all your friends increase your tokenâ€™s liquidity.</p>



<p>What happens (as far as I know, and in Laymenâ€™s) is, as I undertand it, a liquidity pool I can put funds into so that market makers and other parties can execute trades at leverage or for â€˜free-ish.â€™ These funds then produce yield as the market makers have paid fees which gets added to the pot, then available for the liquidity providers to later withdraw. I may be incorrect in my understanding or I may have forgotten something.</p>



<p>Check out an idea I had to generate yield by COMBINING Compound and Uniswap (I know, insane) here:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/Stakedllc/robo-advisor-yield/issues/3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://github.com/Stakedllc/robo-advisor-yield/issues/3</a></p>



<p>And see an idea of mine for integrating Uniswap in their own traditional sense into Staked.usâ€™s RAY here:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/Stakedllc/robo-advisor-yield/issues/6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://github.com/Stakedllc/robo-advisor-yield/issues/6</a></p>



<h1 id="524f">Disclaimer</h1>



<p>No, I donâ€™t work for Staked.</p>



<p>Yes, I am an affiliate and will earn affiliate commissions if you sign up using my links.</p>



<p>No, there are no other affiliate links in this doc â€” I gave an honest and unbiased opinion here, not affiliate spam <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p>Just got a heart-warming email from GitHub about their Sponsors program!My fellow Hackers, have you all applied your most prolific GitHub accounts to join the program? Word to wise: they&#8217;re doubling everyone&#8217;s sponsorship dollar values up to a whopping $5000 USD each and every month for the first calendar year you&#8217;re using their services! That&#8217;s potentially $10,000 income on $5000!</p>

<p>Hi folks!Look at this alpha!In most of my recent&nbsp;<a href="https://hackernoon.com/@jarettrsdunn">https://hackernoon.com/@jarettrsdunn</a>&nbsp;posts which are apparently a 404 but live here:&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/@jarettrsdunn">https://medium.com/@jarettrsdunn</a>, I&#8217;ve been discussing different iterations of my different bots, which are available for public consumption.What&#8217;s new is that the new strategy on Livenet appears to be live and well.. so I&#8217;m going to drop the ReadMe here and see if HackerNoon will allow me to distribute this information here on the platform again <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p>For anyone who&#8217;s interested in such things, my crypto trading bot has seen some huge improvements suggested by our small community.. as of just over 1/2 of a day ago when I added configurable % take profit and configurable % stop loss, after my friend with his $30 on livenet got liquidated and he suggested more failsafes&#8230; also waiting for 3 10-second (by default) bars to confirm a signal to buy/sell&#8230; learning curves :)Testnet #1 balance since 1/4 of a day ago is:gains (margin): 184 %gains (wallet): 213 %Testnet #2 balance since 1/2 of a day ago is:gains (margin): 12.9 %gains (wallet): 32.9 %Note that the second testnet account is using the UI configurable default &#8216;order multiplier&#8217; of 1, while my testnet is using 3x that, amplifying gains :)I&#8217;ve added whitelisting of API keys or account #s so it&#8217;s now ready to sell <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<h1 id="3e39">Introduction</h1>



<p>Deciding when to buy low and sell high is the key to any automated trading strategy. Weâ€™ve been incorporating many theories in our bot as it evolves over time, and this post will summarize them.</p>



<h1 id="6131">RSI</h1>



<p>Donâ€™t buy RSI over 70 â€” donâ€™t sell RSI under 30. Simple. RSIs are minutely arrays in 6 second update intervals separated into 10 instances, checked against the minutely values from the previous 14 values of bids.</p>



<h1 id="ca8a">Bollinger Bands</h1>



<p>Donâ€™t buy over upper BB band. Simple. Same methodology as RSIs except over 9 minutes.</p>



<h1 id="4bd4">Tiered Buy Orders Down the Books</h1>



<p>As the price declines, and we submit buy orders that turn into trades, we submit smaller buy orders for lesser prices. This allows us to scrape differences in the books easier than holding a coin until it appreciates, and allows us to profit more from holding more and more coins at lesser and lesser values in times of volatility â€” all else remaining equal, and after you apply a law of averages that equates to coins gaining and losing less differential than the income youâ€™re scraping. Thereâ€™s a 3 minute delay, though, before placing a new buy order for a pair â€” to avoid holding too too much before it regains and we scrape, mind you!</p>



<h1 id="fdec">â€˜NeverSellAtALossâ€™ Minimum Sale Prices</h1>



<p>Next, we enable a minProfit * buyPrice â€˜minimum sale priceâ€™ per tiered buy order that gets executed. This allows us to ensure or project that weâ€™d earn a certain % per trade, and we can also project what our income might look like should we pay lesser and lesser (even get rebates on) fees. We can be buying and selling, we can be selling, we can be buying further down the books â€” weâ€™ll always anticipate a certain level of income from each individual trade.</p>



<h1 id="7eea">Application 1: Mediumish Liquidity Coins with High Spreads</h1>



<p>For pairs with &gt;% spreads and lesser volumes, we can profit more per trade (and after fees) than the Application 2, even if less trades are executed â€” while enjoying potentially more tradeable pairs. Weâ€™ll hold our coins longer and risk more exposure from some of these coins tanking, but hope that our minProfit is earning enough per scrape to combat that â€” and historical trades by the dev bot and community bots attest to this. Also, fear not shit coins â€” we take the most recent hourly candle and compare the value of volume there vs. the implied volume on the 24 hour ticker, then take the best candidates â€” according to a variable set by our users. The right combination of overall variables allows us to see profits of 1, 2, 3% daily â€” although not riskless.</p>



<h1 id="575d">Application 2: Huge Liquidity Stableish Coins with Low Spreads</h1>



<p>Conversationally, we can eliminate some of that risk in Application 1 by trading stable-er-coins that shouldnâ€™t die when we hold them â€” and we can trade far more often, and earn a lesser percent on the spread but as the dev bot and community bots have proven the configurable variables involved here have the ability to turn quite a hefty profit â€” while the risk still remains youâ€™ll hold a coin that then turns sour, and if youâ€™re trading more often that risk might multiply should your settings not be just rightâ€¦ however as above weâ€™ve seen gains of 1, 2, 3% per day!</p>



<h1 id="84ea">Conclusion</h1>



<p>Whatever combination of variables you dream up on whichever exchange, your odds increase significantly with volume â€” weâ€™ve seen balances as little as 0.003 btc turn 0.2, 1.4 btc/day in volume â€” get in now and achieve a significant reduction in fees to earn your own tidy little pile of (potential) returns!</p>



<h1 id="42f3">FUD and FOMO</h1>



<h1 id="0cb2">1. NeverSellAtALoss â€˜bagâ€™</h1>



<p>Position with negative profit but donâ€™t want to sell at a loss and realize that loss so you donâ€™t sell. This creates a BAG that you carry</p>



<h1 id="ff01">1. Scrape Enough to Not Worry</h1>



<p>I played with a variable that incremented a divisor that started at 1.0001, then after x number minutes it reduced the min sale price by 1.0001, and increased the divisor to 1.00121 or whatever, but,â€¦ with the tiered buy orders all the way down, the goal is to always sell an individual order at a % profit while it scales up and down the books. The theory is that all else remaining equal â€” and with the law of averages saying stuff will decline as much as it inclines, if you index enough pairs and lessen the risk of any one breaking the bell curve â€” with the right spread, volume, minProfit, the scraping should outweigh the â€˜bagâ€™</p>

<p>press â€˜allâ€™ after about 15s</p>



<h1 id="5b2d">Case in Point</h1>



<p>Imagine this hourly graph without the steep drops from paying fees on the green (buy) lines:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/47/1*WmxjLMNzSEUeuSlgJu_VCg.png?q=20" alt=""/></figure>



<p>As a follow-up to this:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/DunnCreativeSS/privateMarketMakerRepo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://github.com/DunnCreativeSS/privateMarketMakerRepo</a>&nbsp;** ask for access **</p>



<p>TL;DR join us here&nbsp;<a href="https://t.me/themarketmakerbot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://t.me/themarketmakerbot</a></p>



<h1 id="7f6a">Elevator Pitch</h1>



<p>Market making on Deribit and BitMex failed because it counted on the market to remain more or less stagnant on the 0.25$ step. Weâ€™re now looking at automating two market making strategies for smaller volume, higher spread pairs.</p>



<h1 id="9d41">Market Maker Trader</h1>



<p>We buy just above the highest bid and sell just below the lowest ask. We repeat this process, using a fraction of account balance in base pairs, until we see the net profits as price fluctuations cancel each other out in the approaching infinity sense â€” while we soak up profits from the spread itself in the â€˜relative ordersâ€™ strategy.</p>



<p>Conversationally, and not coded yet, is the â€˜staggered orderâ€™ strategy, where you pick a maximum and minimum price for that pair and then stagger orders up and down the order book to buy and sell along set intervals.</p>



<p>Resources: Would need servers close to different exchanges.</p>



<p>Scalability: More coins; more scale</p>



<p>Pros: Iâ€™ve had 0.57 bitcoin volume on my deposit of $18 worth of coins on the â€˜relativeâ€™ strategy in the last 24 hours, while sustaining about -0.5% growth. There are other exchanges (some with margin) where we can reproduce the bot, like bitfinex/ethfinex who have a market maker rebate paid monthly in their proprietary coin, or liquid who has a market maker rebate on pairs that were previously on qryptos</p>



<p>Addâ€™l pros: on Binance I can effect a 20% or 40% income on fees via my referral link, on HitBTC the affiliate program is on pause but I may eventually be able to effect 75% â€” although the potential gains from HitBTC affiliate are less as there will eventually be a 0% or rebate on the maker fees</p>



<p>Cons: To prove profitable on Binance or HitBTC, youâ€™d need to eliminate the fees or effect a market maker rebate. On Binance this involves volume as well as holding BNB â€” while still paying some fees, while on HitBTC that only involves building volume first â€” effecting 0% maker fees then 0.01% rebate.&nbsp;<a href="https://hitbtc.com/fee-tier" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://hitbtc.com/fee-tier</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.binance.com/en/fee/schedule" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.binance.com/en/fee/schedule</a>&nbsp;On HitBTC thereâ€™s also a market making program&nbsp;<a href="https://hitbtc.com/mm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://hitbtc.com/mm</a>.</p>



<h1 id="3ad0">To Prove for Viability</h1>



<h1 id="d4f5">Consistent over all types of markets, but identify when it does better</h1>



<p>In the long run, price volatility helps the â€˜staggeredâ€™ strategy more than it does the â€˜relativeâ€™ strategy<br>Less volatility but still having volume, there will be gains from the â€˜relativeâ€™ strategy<br>The potential loss is 1. Fees 2. Grabbing a coin that immediately dies, inclusive.<br>If youâ€™re to eliminate fees or effect a fee rebate, this risk goes down<br>If you automate many pairs you lessen the negative effect of grabbing a coin that dies<br>Conversationally, a stop loss can be created to further lessen this risk</p>



<h1 id="e285">Sunk costs of development</h1>



<p>None â€” need to code the â€˜staggeredâ€™ strategy, which I can do</p>



<h1 id="fcfb">Scalability given current market liquidity and volume</h1>



<p>On exchanges like Binance or HitBTC, with many coin pairs that have significant volume, we can scale indefinitely<br>The bot currently checks the average volume per base asset, then the spread of a given pair, and enters only into those markets that meet the minimum and maximum volumes and target spread, as well as a minimum order quantity and maximum order quantity (to avoid sh#tcoins)</p>



<p>In base: market pair: volume in base, that looks like this:</p>



<p>{ BTC: { XDNBTC: 69.3393775486, VETBTC: 42.606415325 },<br>TUSD: { NXTUSD: 67247.7248096, TNTUSD: 53891.073732 },<br>MUSD: { QTUMUSD: 2545776.043225 },<br>NUSD: { XDNUSD: 280614.7629689 },<br>DUSD: { MAIDUSD: 54019.8292817 },<br>ETH:<br>{ ICXETH: 589.145211656,<br>NXTETH: 266.992269315,<br>REPETH: 616.456689351,<br>ONTETH: 5359.788369161,<br>NTKETH: 197.416308344,<br>KBCETH: 355.311810444,<br>ROXETH: 311.845628547 },<br>BUSD: { DGBUSD: 2445.14526651 },<br>GUSD: { BTGUSD: 141765.29622322 },<br>UUSD: { QNTUUSD: 29.4731369 },<br>PUSD: { ETPUSD: 68.5015549, ZAPUSD: 40.1461164 },<br>YUSD: { DAYUSD: 338.8757426, BERRYUSD: 248.9052084 },<br>QUSD: { STQUSD: 6039.7474451 },<br>IUSD: { WIKIUSD: 10575.2656811 },<br>FUSD: { ELFUSD: 14.04120135 },<br>URS:<br>{ ETHEURS: 2486.24206583,<br>LTCEURS: 1485.789705,<br>XMREURS: 2807.0239136 },<br>â€˜0USDâ€™: { POA20USD: 20.1087685 },<br>EOS: { LSKEOS: 39.06901764 },<br>RWB: { BTCKRWB: 44.82036 } }</p>



<h1 id="dc50">Forward Tests</h1>



<p>This strategy was first coded about 48 hours ago on Binance. It lost about 0.5% in one day, and had 0.46 BTC in volume.</p>



<figure><iframe src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimgur.com%2FqEyq1ZB&amp;src=https%3A%2F%2Fimgur.com%2FqEyq1ZB%2Fembed%3Fpub%3Dtrue%26ref%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fembed.ly%26w%3D607&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;schema=imgur" allowfullscreen="" height="364" width="607"></iframe></figure>



<p>The second iteration was on HitBTC, and as of about 10â€“12 hours ago has 0.12 BTC in volume (across many smaller orders, instead of the test version on Binance risking everything on one pair).</p>



<figure><iframe src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimgur.com%2FU6p4pX6&amp;src=https%3A%2F%2Fimgur.com%2FU6p4pX6%2Fembed%3Fpub%3Dtrue%26ref%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fembed.ly%26w%3D500&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;schema=imgur" allowfullscreen="" height="339" width="500"></iframe></figure>



<p>Itâ€™s lost about 0.23% in that time:</p>



<figure><iframe src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimgur.com%2FxEk6xe4&amp;src=https%3A%2F%2Fimgur.com%2FxEk6xe4%2Fembed%3Fpub%3Dtrue%26ref%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fembed.ly%26w%3D598&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;schema=imgur" allowfullscreen="" height="335" width="598"></iframe></figure>



<p>My calculations, based on losing 0.5% a day on average with entry level fees and based on HitBTCâ€™s 0% maker fee after 1500BTC in 30-day volume, indicate that after a certain amount of time while trading a certain balance we can effect 0% fees, and therein effect profits:</p>

<p>This is not including the chance we can get market maker benefits or the 0.01%<br>rebate after 6000 BTC volume.</p>

<p>This bot automates making markets on Binance.</p>



<p>Where other market making bots fail (ie. BitMex, Deribit, other attempts Iâ€™ve made in the past) is by counting on the market to not be volatile. Where this bot wins is by finding markets where we can soak up profits in the volatility by taking those profits from the spread itself, where on BitMex and Deribit these spreads ar 0.25$ of a BTC, some smaller markets on Binance have 1%.. 2%â€¦ 5% spreads, and greater-than-average volumes.</p>



<p>Youâ€™ll want to have about $20 per market pair itâ€™s looking to trade, in the base asset (BTC, BNB, ETH, etcâ€¦). It will look to trade more markets if the targetSpread, targetVolDiv, targetVolMult are higher. The more total funds in a particular base asset there are, the higher value the orders will have.</p>



<p>If for whatever reason a market pair leaves the universe scope of considered pairs, it will continue selling that asset with the same sell logic (on the quoteAsset+BNB market, or BTC then ETH if BNB isnâ€™t available), while pausing buying it.</p>



<p>I donâ€™t have enough personal funds available to run the bot, but I can get a good amount of income if I share it and people use my ref link. targetOrderSizeMult exists so that people can compete using the same bot on the same markets without it just outbidding the other bot constantly, as you can set a % of your order size to ignore when thereâ€™s a bid or ask better than yours. When the volume that beats your price is higher than the â€”</p>



<p>order size * this multiplier,</p>



<p>itâ€™ll re-enter the market.</p>



<p>â€˜At the current time Binance rate limits are: 1200 requests per minute. 10 orders per second. 100,000 orders per 24hrs.â€™</p>



<p>There are no limits for unfilled orders, and at most itâ€™ll make about 6&#215;20 or so pairs x 2 orders, 1 cancel and 1 re-post a minute, along with checking balance and getting order books so a total of about ~500 a minute â€” not close to 1200 <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p>On that note Iâ€™ve only been trading one pair, averaging 42 orders an hour or ~1000 per day, again by about 20 pairs would be 20 000 orders per day â€” a bit shy of 100k.</p>



<p>To use:</p>



<p>1. (please do) sign up for Binance using my ref link:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.binance.com/?ref=27039658" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.binance.com/?ref=27039658</a></p>



<p>2. Place your Binance API key and secret in binance.js</p>



<p>3. Optionally change the targetSpread, targetVolDiv, targetVolMult, targetOrderSizeMult</p>



<p>4. Install NPM and Node</p>



<p>5. Clone this repo, cd into directory</p>



<p>6. Run npm i binance-api-node</p>



<p>7. Run node binance.js</p>



<h1 id="fac3">API Rate Limiting?</h1>



<p>The first FUD someone might say is that this will lock your API for too many unfilled orders or too many interactions.</p>



<p>â€˜At the current time Binance rate limits are: 1200 requests per minute. 10 orders per second. 100,000 orders per 24hrs.â€™</p>



<p>There are no limits for unfilled orders, and at most itâ€™ll make about 6x 20 or so pairs x 2 orders, 1 cancel and 1 re-post a minute, along with checking balance and getting order books so a total of about ~500 a minute â€” not close to 1200 <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p>On that note Iâ€™ve only been trading three or so pairs at a time, averaging 42 orders an hour or ~1000 per day, again by about 20 pairs would be 20 000 orders per day â€” a bit shy of 100k.</p>



<h1 id="0cd8">Conclusion</h1>



<p>I was originally trading GNTBNB almost exclusively for testing, the first trade is screenshotted. Iâ€™ve since opened it up to trade anything it noticed it could trade, made the required spread lower, and let it run overnight. Itâ€™s lost a bit of value but itâ€™s also held eth for awhile while not doing anything with it (due to the required spread % not being enough), but over 45 orders (excluding cancelled) with 0.00568192 balance (or so) I have 0.03090300 in volume â€” meaning that while it lost ~3% BTC and ~4% USD it traded the original 0.00568192 back and forth for 22â€“23 round trips @ 0.2% fees, beating the 4.5% fees it enduredâ€¦ with more careful settings it should perform better or at least act on less orders and capitalize higher spreads.</p>



<p>If youâ€™re looking to start building your volume on Binance, the easiest way would be to put this bot to work and choose some safer settings to automate the spreads of a few pairs â€” after trading a few hours with 0.00568192 balance (or so) I have 0.03090300 in volume. While this strategy might not automate profits (at least out of the box), it does trade a whole heck of a lot. If you check&nbsp;<a href="https://www.binance.com/en/fee/schedule" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Binanceâ€™s fee schedule</a>, youâ€™ll see that as you graduate levels of volume and hold BNB then youâ€™ll be treated to lesser and lesser maker/taker fees, which might prove healthy should you have other strategies (especially high-frequency-trading) that would benefit from lesser fees â€” although the BNB requirements might be high, given the current value of a BNB has exploded. Again, should you use my invite code 27039658 or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.binance.com/?ref=27039658" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">invite link</a>&nbsp;Iâ€™ll get a tiny slice of the rewards, too!</p>

<p>Jarett Dunn, [21.03.19 15:35]<br>ok going to start a new set of conditions for a strategy using the bot, mark @ benchmark 2 Estimated Valueï¼š 0.00569181 BTC / $22.57</p>



<p>Jarett Dunn, [21.03.19 15:35]<br>note it held Eth during a major Eth crash</p>
