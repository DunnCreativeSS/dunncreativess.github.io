<h2>Strategy</h2>



<ol><li>We follow Twitter accounts we trust: exchanges, coins, Twitter crypto influencers</li><li>We wait around until someone tweets a coin name or coin ticker</li><li>We measure the sentiment of the message: is it buy or sell?</li><li>On strong buys, or multiple instances of buys in a period of time, we execute a market buy order on Binance Spot</li><li>We wait around until our exits are hit</li><li>1 out of every 3-4 signals we act on the crowd will also act on&#8230; </li><li>&#8230;meaning there&#8217;s upwards potential for everyone</li><li>and we can net 100s 1000s% gains!</li></ol>



<p>In practice:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-10.png" alt="" class="wp-image-205" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-10.png 862w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-10-300x289.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-10-768x739.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 862px) 100vw, 862px" /><figcaption> <br></figcaption></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/666371834102677565/667093503817547794/tempFileForShare_20200115-205117.jpg?width=340&amp;height=659" alt=""/></figure>



<h2>NLTK &amp; New Words</h2>



<p>The Python programming language has a package called Natural Language Tool Kit, or NLTK. Inside NLTK are lexicons that you can use to accomplish different goals &#8211; in our project, the Vader Lexicon is useful because we can rank all sorts of English words on a scale of -1 to 1 based on how strongly they express good or bad emotions. This is called &#8216;sentiment analysis.&#8217;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-8.png" alt="" class="wp-image-203" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-8.png 451w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-8-300x199.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-8-120x80.png 120w" sizes="(max-width: 451px) 100vw, 451px" /></figure>



<p>We add some new words to the mix.. given our very specific scenario.</p>



<h2>Weighted Twitter Accounts and Tiers</h2>



<p>Of the accounts in our followed list, we&#8217;ll have exchanges, coins and crypto influencers. Of these, exchanges have the highest amount of influence when they make an announcement about an alt, the coins themselves have a medium amount and the influencers have a variable but usually less amount.</p>



<p>We organize each account we follow (or simply have in a static list) into a list with corresponding ratios for how they affect our sentiment scores. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-9.png" alt="" class="wp-image-204" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-9.png 304w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-9-300x128.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 304px) 100vw, 304px" /></figure>



<h2>Parsing and Referencing All the Binance Spot Coins</h2>



<p>Here&#8217;s what Binance&#8217;s 24hr ticker endpoint looks like:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-11.png" alt="" class="wp-image-206" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-11.png 649w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-11-217x300.png 217w" sizes="(max-width: 649px) 100vw, 649px" /></figure>



<p>We loop through all these results, look for ones that end in BTC and then replace the BTC out of the symbol string &#8211; leaving the coin. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-12-1024x172.png" alt="" class="wp-image-207" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-12-1024x172.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-12-300x50.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-12-768x129.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-12-1536x258.png 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-12.png 1890w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>We now have a list of coins!</p>



<h2>Get Twitter Followed, 100 Recent Tweets Within Last Hour</h2>



<p>This is optional and I may replace the followed list with a flat and static file or coded list, but presently the bot will read the followed list and then loop through it, grabbing everyone&#8217;s 100 most recent tweets (and and/or and not retweets &#8211; optional) and then cycle through those to see which occurred in the last (given timeframe). These are the goldmoney&#8230; we save tweets we&#8217;ve previously indexed to an array so as to not re-index them.</p>



<h2>Find Potential Coinnames, Compare to Our Binance List and Tweeter List</h2>



<p>We split the text of the tweets up by &#8216; &#8216; (space) and &#8216;\n&#8217; (newline). We then look at each resulting word or hashtag, capitalize them and compare them (or $ + the word, like $MANA or $mana or mana or Mana) against our list of tickers from the Binance API. We also then compare against a list of tickers that correspond to specific Twitter accounts, in the event of something like the MANA tweet above that didn&#8217;t mention &#8216;MANA.&#8217; So we can tell that decentraland tweets are, usually, unless otherwise specified, for MANA.</p>



<h2>For High Sentiment Scores, Buy</h2>



<p>On Binance we market buy with a % of our holdings. The % is configurable, and depends on someone&#8217;s aversion to risk.</p>



<h2>For Repeat Occurrences, Buy Again</h2>



<p>If another one of our trusted tweeters tweets another signal confirming the same trend, we &#8216;double down&#8217; and buy another % of remaining balance worth of the coin.</p>



<h2>1% Trailing Take Profit</h2>



<p>If the price immediately drops 1%, we gracefully exit as a stoploss and count our losses. If the price goes up 2% and then down 1%, we exit the trade at 1% gains less fees. If, however, the coin goes up 10% 40% 100% before dropping 1% &#8211; as it might do with mass hysteria &#8211; then we laugh all the way to the bank! 1%, of course, is configurable.</p>



<h2>Rinse, Wash, Repeat</h2>



<p>Another signal another coin another potential 100%!</p>



<h2>Considerations</h2>



<p>We want to use a custom list of crypto influencers because most of the people calling out signals on twitter are actually doing so in their own vested interest &#8211; having posted a buy signal in their private Pump &amp; Dump discords, their private group buys up the coin and then &#8211; 5 minutes later &#8211; they all post signals to their twitters and bought &#8216;influencer&#8217; twitters as tweets that seem to double, triply, quadruply confirm each other. In reality, these folks are dumping by the time anyone else starts to buy in &#8211; meaning that you&#8217;d likely face losses if you used a twitter-wide sentiment analysis and automated trading tool. This is where all existing tools &#8211; including AI-driven ones &#8211; fail in this space, and why my bot has a considerable edge on the competition.</p>



<h2>Next Steps</h2>



<p>I&#8217;d like the bot to keep track of the win/lose rate and severity of wins/losses from specific tweeters, so that it can potentially modify the sentiment score by a previous success factor &#8211; so if someone was right about a buy signal 2/5 times it&#8217;s worth more than someone with 1/5 times. If someone is right 1/10 times, though, and their signal does 25x better than the first two in these examples &#8211; that one is worth considerably more.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-13-1024x629.png" alt="" class="wp-image-208" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-13-1024x629.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-13-300x184.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-13-768x471.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-13.png 1471w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>It&#8217;d be nice to incorporate a python django webserver like a hackathon starter so I can take advantage of their Twitter oauth2 sign-in scheme. This way I can potentially have accounts log in without supplying their own twitter API credentials &#8211; which require an application process now &#8211; and more accounts can work with my bot. This would increase the amount of actionable data and win/loss rates and severities that can be used to package tailored lists of tweeters to know.</p>

<p><a href="http://jare.cloud/2020/01/14/top-money-making-decentralized-finance-defi-applications/">View this content in it&#8217;s original form, on jare.cloud</a>!</p>



<h1 id="cfa9">Preface</h1>



<p>Today we’ll discuss some of the top Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications that exist, serving people in a trustless manner around the world.</p>



<p>What do I mean by trustless? Given Ether’s immutable (cannot change) smart contracts, the behavior of the money moved around DeFi is such that it cannot be stolen, hacked, lost or misappropriated. Moreover, to earn the word ‘trustless,’ I don’t have to put my trust into a given person or organization — instead, I trust the underlying technology of the contracts they’ve devised. It’s trustless!</p>



<p>I’ve separated the following doc into four sections, comparing the platforms in each: Trading, Borrowing, WBTC Borrowing, and Lending.</p>



<h1 id="f070">Trading</h1>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image.png" alt="" class="wp-image-180" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image.png 892w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-300x139.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-768x356.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 892px) 100vw, 892px" /></figure>



<p>With up to 5x leverage available to traders, dydxprotocol at&nbsp;<a href="http://dydx.exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dydx.exchange</a>&nbsp;and folks like&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/u/b3d17ffd3219?source=post_page-----75a757dc6408----------------------" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Antonio Juliano</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/u/67f0a6970a7c?source=post_page-----75a757dc6408----------------------" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zhuoxun Yin</a>&nbsp;bring you a beautiful night-mode interface that allows you to trade some of your favorite assets. Some people — especially those burned by Mt. Gox or other exit scams — are risk-averse to what we call ‘counterparty risk.’ What this means is that some people would much rather have less single points of failure when it comes to the custody of their money — and now we can even trade with leverage on platforms like dydx, so who needs centralized exchanges and their bankster owners?</p>



<p>Dydx lets you borrow, too, but we’ll discuss that more in detail in a future section of this article.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1358/1*b6kUKIB8rLIy9QBa_KE7hw.png" alt=""/></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1264/1*Bb6NKV_XMMXdEZkAw1_cfQ.png" alt=""/></figure>



<p>I do like how the people at <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://fulcrum.trade/" target="_blank">fulcrum.trade</a> (their parent org: bZx) separated their trading interface from their borrowing interface. We’ll have a closer look at their not-for-margin-trading borrowing interface in a later section, but the fulcrum.trade interface lacks some of the leverage available to dydx — although that negative is helped by having a broader selection of coins.</p>



<h1 id="2015">Borrowing</h1>



<p>With a resounding set of achieved milestones and growth,&nbsp;<a href="http://compound.finance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">compound.finance</a>&nbsp;and some of the team&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/u/54f6f223cd12?source=post_page-----75a757dc6408----------------------" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Robert Leshner</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/u/8808a762900f?source=post_page-----75a757dc6408----------------------" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Calvin Liu</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/u/42c8b7010550?source=post_page-----75a757dc6408----------------------" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jayson Hobby</a>&nbsp;have been building another Ether unicorn to add to our growing list.</p>



<p>With millions under management, and a wide variety of coins to choose from to use as collateral, Compound provides a unique opportunity in traditional financial history. It’s apparent that we can over-collateralize loans in crypto against stablecoins and be long those cryptos while getting spending money for the time being — the bullish attitude we have towards these cryptos says that their underlying growth in equity value will outperform the interest rates we’re paying on our stablecoin loans. Boom, we’ve just earned ‘free-ish’ crypto!</p>



<p>Wait, though, this really only applies to Ether and the Ethereum tokens listed on Compound At Time of Writing, and doesn’t appear to apply to WBTC? I really had hoped to diversify my collateral I’m holding to maximize the upwards potential of both DeFi and The King of Coins, $BTC!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2019/1*ar7ch_ZSKslofPWRdvGJQg.png" alt=""/></figure>



<p>(See, a ‘Collateral Factor’ of 0% means we can’t use Wrapped BTC as a collateral coin).</p>



<p>Whatever are we to do?</p>



<h1 id="1990">Borrowing Against WBTC</h1>



<p>Like I’d mentioned above,&nbsp;<a href="http://bzx.network/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bzx.network</a>&nbsp;has the tools&nbsp;<a href="http://fulcrum.trade/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fulcrum.trade</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://torque.loans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">torque.loans</a>, and some of the people working wonders like&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/u/e65fe39afe1d?source=post_page-----75a757dc6408----------------------" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nick Sawinyh</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/u/7c5899852965?source=post_page-----75a757dc6408----------------------" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kyle J Kistner</a>&nbsp;or their team account here&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/u/c84b634c7ca3?source=post_page-----75a757dc6408----------------------" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bZx Team</a>. We discussed fulcrum.trade above and hinted at the existence of torque.loans — as a flipside of the same coin, instead of lending and borrowing under-collateralized loans for the purpose of margin trading (a la dydx) we can lend and borrow over-collateralized loans for the purpose of hedging, or whatever other purpose you had in mind (a la compound)!</p>



<p>Simply load up your MetaMask or other wallet, select the token to receive, change your collateral to WBTC and — oh, spoke too soon! Found an error among all tokens when selecting WBTC as collateral.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2489/1*7FQA5lzB_AAtgsnIVkEJsg.png" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Wonder if there’s a bug bounty…</p>



<p><em>Soon</em>! You’ll be able to achieve all that diversification and goodness I was speaking about earlier.</p>



<p>EDIT: 15 minutes after my Tweet to bZx and everyone else, at some ungodly hour in the morning that it is right now:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*APv0pSO6xIE8ozzlL9sNvA.png" alt=""/></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1134/1*AGRk-fkbzxjZQ2RZ7dhrsw.png" alt=""/></figure>



<p>When was the last time your banks answered the phone that quick?</p>



<p>EDIT AGAIN: It looks as though the bug was on my side, and it’s working fine now that I’ve restarted my machine trying to take a screencast for their team — all is good in the hood, and likely no cause for alarm! I’m going to leave this little diversion in here about the bug-that-could-have-been, because it illustrats how prompt, friendly and helpful bZx’s team are.</p>



<p><a href="https://twitter.com/jarettdunn/status/1216982964233437185" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Check Out the Chat and Follow My Twitter</a>!</p>



<h1 id="85de">Lending</h1>



<p>What do diversified assets and Albert Einstein have in common?</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1181/1*KlOBylBk6AmLAj9PNKQO1w.png" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Einstein knew that being on the winning side of compound interest would free people — and diversifying your portfolio is step #1 to earning consistent returns. All our moms (or indeed dads, or indeed people-y people) told us ‘don’t put all your eggs in one basket,’ right?</p>



<p>Here’s where stuff gets interesting. Because the three solutions noted above are all open-source and allow and encourage people to develop tools to add to their utility,&nbsp;<a href="http://staked.us/?pid=fr5BC09Vgc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">staked.us</a>&nbsp;of course at&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/u/2e226f754735?source=post_page-----75a757dc6408----------------------" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Staked</a>&nbsp;developed their tool&nbsp;<a href="https://staked.us/v/robo-advisor-yield/?pid=fr5BC09Vgc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Robo Advisor for Yield</a>. Edit: Shoutout to their man&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/u/94138e7bc2b8?source=post_page-----75a757dc6408----------------------" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Devan Purhar</a>, who handles all my support tickets I’ve had on their GitHub (one example link and ensuing conversation to follow). Much appreciated!</p>



<p>What’s it do?</p>



<p>At present, it indexes Compound, dydx, and fulcrum.trade and gives you the best rate among each of them — meaning that if you were to have Robo Advisors for Eth, USDC, DAI and SAI, you’d be earning the best yields for four different assets (one might moon! And: eth staking, coming soon!) — maybe more different assets in the future:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/Stakedllc/robo-advisor-yield/issues/5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://github.com/Stakedllc/robo-advisor-yield/issues/5</a>&nbsp;at any given point.</p>



<p>They’ve used on-chain, open-source solutions in the keeping with crypto spirit and in order to bolster the offerings of the participant protocols. This means that they add a layer to the tech without adding a party to be considered when thinking about counterparty risk — the trust is still in the tech (which has all been thoroughly audited, be sure)!</p>



<h1 id="050e">Conclusion</h1>



<p>So head on over to&nbsp;<a href="http://staked.us/?pid=fr5BC09Vgc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">staked.us</a>, check out their platform where you can earn returns on staking PoS coins, but more importantly check out their&nbsp;<a href="https://staked.us/v/robo-advisor-yield/?pid=fr5BC09Vgc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Robo Advisor for Yield</a>&nbsp;today. You can mint your own RAYs and begin the journey to doubling your crypto, too!</p>



<p>Looking to trade undercollateralized loans, on the blockchain and without a third party? Check out some of the other solutions, like dydx.exchange and fulcrum.trade.</p>



<p>Looking to borrow funds against your crypto? I’d recommend compound.finance or torque.loans.</p>



<p>DeFi is here to stay — banking the unbanked — let the games commence!</p>



<h1 id="0d3a">Bonus 1: Nuo.Network</h1>



<p>Nuo.network (with an encouring team including team account&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/u/d834ca07a5ac?source=post_page-----75a757dc6408----------------------" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nuo Network</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/u/29f0b8f49104?source=post_page-----75a757dc6408----------------------" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Varun Deshpande</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/u/2e63d860a40d?source=post_page-----75a757dc6408----------------------" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Siddharth Verma</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/u/a48f2610a12d?source=post_page-----75a757dc6408----------------------" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Praneet Sinha</a>&nbsp;allows you to lend and borrow — including WBTC — and margin trade using non-custodial addresses, like the other contenders in this list.</p>



<p>Why didn’t Nuo make the original list?</p>



<p>Their smart contracts aren’t public — meaning that&nbsp;the interface to build on nuo.network is controlled by their team, and doesn’t allow folks to create additional value by plugging pieces together and offering something brand new — like&nbsp;<a href="https://staked.us/v/robo-advisor-yield/?pid=fr5BC09Vgc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">staked.us’s Robo Advisor for Yield</a>&nbsp;does.</p>



<p>However, the Staked team reassures us that they’ve been in touch with Nuo’s and that — pending an upcoming update — the code will be public and the joys of Nuo can be introduced into the Robo Advisor for Yield.</p>



<p>Check more details on this post I made outlining Nuo as a possible way to earn yield (and earn yield on WBTC) on Staked’s RAY:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/Stakedllc/robo-advisor-yield/issues/5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://github.com/Stakedllc/robo-advisor-yield/issues/5</a></p>



<h1 id="3258">Bonus 2: Uniswap</h1>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1389/1*h9q1b-UntQQAeNW0MQfWMw.png" alt=""/></figure>

These include swapping Ether tokens and paying a small fee all the way up to submitting your own new exchange (token) to the network and having all your friends increase your token’s liquidity.</p>



<p>What happens (as far as I know, and in Laymen’s) is, as I undertand it, a liquidity pool I can put funds into so that market makers and other parties can execute trades at leverage or for ‘free-ish.’ These funds then produce yield as the market makers have paid fees which gets added to the pot, then available for the liquidity providers to later withdraw. I may be incorrect in my understanding or I may have forgotten something.</p>



<p>Check out an idea I had to generate yield by COMBINING Compound and Uniswap (I know, insane) here:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/Stakedllc/robo-advisor-yield/issues/3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://github.com/Stakedllc/robo-advisor-yield/issues/3</a></p>

<p>Everyone read this helpful article on <a href="https://www.hywel.me/static/site/wordpress/2016/07/17/fast-free-static-website-with-wordpress-and-github-pages.html">how to export static WordPress stuff to Github.io</a> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p>Works like a breeze except I don&#8217;t think you need to change your branch over, more info to come&#8230;</p>



<p>Now, a blog that won&#8217;t die in the fire of a series of unfortunate events like VPSs going down or a domain expiring. Hola! Hooah!</p>



<p>That&#8217;s it that&#8217;s all &#8211; for now, folks!</p>
