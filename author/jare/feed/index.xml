<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-15-1024x471.png" alt="" class="wp-image-70" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-15-1024x471.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-15-300x138.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-15-768x353.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-15-1536x706.png 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-15.png 1805w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p><a href="https://dunncreativess.github.io/2019/11/17/poc-bot-1-up-31-5-in-5-hours-3-max-drawdown/">View This Post in It&#8217;s Original Form on dunncreativess.github.io</a>!</p>



<p>With nearly 31 BTC notional traded in recent memory, this bot Proof Of Concept even survived last night&#8217;s dump and subsequent pump and ended up 6% ROI after all was said and done. Aweo!</p>



<p>You can <a href="http://patbot1.duckdns.org/">follow the delta graph for this so-far unnamed bot here</a>.</p>



<p>The competing bot with like logic &#8211; less one indicator to confirm &#8211; lost a good 5% ROI during that dump &amp; pump. Less risk = more reward, in this sense!</p>



<p>This bot&#8217;s performance at 20x leverage on Binance Futures is defined by it&#8217;s subroutines, finding price action among an index vs. another index (sorry can&#8217;t divulge more because of NDA) then acting when it&#8217;s doubly confirmed by a volume and a price volatility indicator. For the win!</p>



<p>The best news? This bot&#8217;s creator (who shall remain unnamed for the time being, until he decides to come to light&#8230;) will be charging a monthly subscription fee of $59 USDT &#8211; and $10 USDT of that goes to affiliate referrers, indefinitely!</p>



<p><a href="https://t.me/ManyVolumeSignalMonster">Sign up for our Telegram bot chat room here</a>, to discuss eligibility for coming onboard this bot in it&#8217;s alpha v1.0 form or starting to refer people to it for your own fun &amp; profit!</p>



<p>In more detail, let&#8217;s look at the most recent hour&#8217;s graph of delta on delta&#8230;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-16-1024x393.png" alt="" class="wp-image-71" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-16-1024x393.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-16-300x115.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-16-768x295.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-16-1536x590.png 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-16.png 1827w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Recovering from a 1.5% loss when it entered into a larger position, it&#8217;s slowly climbed from there &#8211; reaching a whopping 31.5% delta and a current +0.617 BTC position.</p>



<p>Running this bot on other balances with other risk factors has been enlightening &#8211; following a liquidation of a small balance at 125x in a dump a few nights ago, the safer bets have been on smaller leverage and smaller order sizes.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-17-1024x45.png" alt="" class="wp-image-72" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-17-1024x45.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-17-300x13.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-17-768x34.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-17.png 1113w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-18-1024x200.png" alt="" class="wp-image-73" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-18-1024x200.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-18-300x59.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-18-768x150.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-18.png 1119w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>For the win!</p>

<p>Find this article where <a href="https://dunncreativess.github.io/2019/11/16/top-actionable-tips-to-grow-a-community-more-tips-to-monetize/">it was originally published, on dunncreativess.github.io</a>!</p>



<ul><li>Find a Niche!<br><br>Nobody can promote themselves or their projects if they&#8217;re a jack of all trades. Nor will people find a universal proposition to be appealing. The first key to success is to ask yourself what your differentiating features are and who is your audience? You can then start to identify your niche.<br><br>In my case, I noticed that I got a lot more traffic from my money-making code like market making or arbtitrage crypto trading bots than I did from my other GitHub repos. What this means is that while some people are interested in interesting code, there are a lot more people out there interested in turning equity into realized pnl <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><br>ï»¿</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-10-1024x490.png" alt="" class="wp-image-62" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-10-1024x490.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-10-300x144.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-10-768x367.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-10-1536x735.png 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-10.png 1900w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<ul><li>Engage!<br><br>If you&#8217;re going to invite people to your community, you&#8217;d best welcome newcomers and engage in conversation. Building rapport is key in sales and it&#8217;s key in life &#8211; this is how you win people&#8217;s trust and influence friends. Basically you&#8217;ll want to prove that you&#8217;re a regular ol&#8217; team player and that you both enjoy and actually rely on the community itself that you&#8217;re building.<br></li><li>Add Value!<br><br>Do you perform a service? Do you create a product? Do you contribute to a larger cause that does? If so, you can package something about your work and add it for free in exchange for email addresses, subscribers, Telegram users.. whathaveyou! See:</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-12.png" alt="" class="wp-image-64" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-12.png 800w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-12-276x300.png 276w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-12-768x834.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></figure>



<ul><li>Ask for Email Subscribers, Telegram Group Joins, or ___ Methods for Continued Contact!<br><br>Speaking of signups.. don&#8217;t be afraid to ask! You&#8217;ll see at the end of most of my recent articles (where I&#8217;m adding value to other, larger communities&#8230; hint hint&#8230;.) that I&#8217;m adding additional value in exchange for email signups. You miss 100% of the shots you don&#8217;t take, no?<br></li><li>Engage More!<br><br>Great! You&#8217;re picking up traction now that you&#8217;ve applied the previous steps. Now, as your community grows further you might not have as much time to nurture each individual as much, so maybe try some more large-scale engagement processes: competitions, polls, Google forms, whathaveyou! Nobody said you couldn&#8217;t be inventive. Make use of pinned messages on Telegram or other such one-time, semi-permanent devices.<br></li><li>Promote From Within!<br><br>Your followers are your most avid fans, so if you get to the point where you might need a community manager then just ask your most prolific followers &#8211; chances are they&#8217;ll trade some of their time gratis just to support your cause. Now there&#8217;s a good friend, no?<br></li><li>Cross-Syndicate!<br><br>Post wherever you can! Comment on relevant posts! Get your links up there! Find the best Domain Authority sites you can freely post on (like Medium.com, Hackernoon (after a review process), GitHub.io and get the links flowing back to your own blog for some good SEO juices to boost your search engine ranking! Do yourself a favor and google 2019 SEO techniques &#8211; but also don&#8217;t get buried in the theory, it changes fundamentally with each and every search engine update :(!<br></li><li>Don&#8217;t Be Afraid to Ask for Tips &#8211; or Better Yet, Package Something and Sell It!<br><br>Are you a developer? Check out GitHub sponsors! Are you into Crypto? Drop your Blockchain address and ask your followers for donations! <br></li></ul>

<ul><li>Are you creating content? <br><br>Write a book and put it on Amazon Kindle! Then, notify your email subscriber list you&#8217;ve been building with this recent success&#8230; you&#8217;ll be surprised how often your loyal subs will turn into a sale instead of unsubscribe!</li></ul>

<p><a href="https://dunncreativess.github.io/2019/11/16/market-maker-at-10-realized-live-gains-signal-based-bots-at-1-7/">See this post on it&#8217;s original location, github.io</a>!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-2-1024x722.png" alt="" class="wp-image-19" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-2-1024x722.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-2-300x212.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-2-768x542.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-2.png 1428w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption><br></figcaption></figure>



<p>It&#8217;s been a busy few days for me!</p>



<h2>What&#8217;s Current</h2>



<p>As I&#8217;d mentioned on Hackernoon before, <a href="https://hackernoon.com/porting-a-bot-to-binance-futures-market-making-competition-6v6a31qh">Coindex and I are admitted into the Binance Futures Market Making Competition</a>. This bot is currently being fed into the AI with competing genomes using different input variables, to give us the winning generations in terms of configurations. We&#8217;re running this market making bot on Deribit testnet and livenet &#8211; showing 10% gains on livenet, almost 50% on testnet, but these livenet results aren&#8217;t being published anywhere &#8211; yet!</p>



<p><a href="http://coindexbot.duckdns.org:8080/">You can watch the market maker on Deribit testnet in realtime here</a> &#8211; which will soon be integrated to <a href="https://coindexlabs.com/">coindexlabs.com</a>!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-3-1024x398.png" alt="" class="wp-image-20" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-3-1024x398.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-3-300x117.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-3-768x299.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-3-1536x597.png 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-3.png 1896w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Next up is the first bot I was hired to create in the last week. Without breaching terms of NDA, it executes trades based on a series of custom price action indicators confirmed twice by regular ol&#8217; indicators. It&#8217;s currently up 0.7% in the last three hours on Binance Futures <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><br><br>You can <a href="http://patbot1.duckdns.org/">watch it live with one indicator confirming trend here</a>, <a href="http://patbo2.duckdns.org/">or two indicators to lessen the noise here</a>!</p>



<p>This bot will be available for a small subscription fee in the future times, and the benefactor has even agreed to share some of that subscription money with me &#8211; for the win! It&#8217;s so far been running 2-3 days in profit. Aweo! This bot&#8217;s ideationmaster has given me more and more income to add indicators, exchanges, and in the future it will even have Telegram bot reporting. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f600.png" alt="ðŸ˜€" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-4-1024x500.png" alt="" class="wp-image-21" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-4-1024x500.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-4-300x147.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-4-768x375.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-4-1536x750.png 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-4.png 1892w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>A second bot I was created to hire uses a genius system to identify support and resistence, and enters in Binance Futures limit post-only too &#8211; exiting when trends reverse at market and entering in new post-only orders to win in the next trend. It&#8217;s currently up 6.5% although it hasn&#8217;t traded in a little while, have no fear! It requires the trend to be confirmed one way or another over the course of some other safety inputs.</p>



<p><a href="http://coindexbot.duckdns.org/">You can watch the delta of the delta for this one live here</a>. I don&#8217;t know if this bot&#8217;s benefactor wants to sell access to his creations or just throw some serious capital at them &#8211; stay tuned for details! Either way, he has decided he&#8217;s going to continue feeding me bot projects so I can concentrate on being productive while having the ol&#8217; rent paid <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="ðŸ˜‰" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<h2>What&#8217;s Next</h2>



<p>Coindex and myself and some of the bot ideationmasters we&#8217;ve mentioned will be working on ways to hedge losses in the case our bots see stoplosses.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-5-1024x542.png" alt="" class="wp-image-22" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-5-1024x542.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-5-300x159.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-5-768x406.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-5-1536x813.png 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-5.png 1890w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>What this means for Coindex at least is to use different entries for long calls+puts on the same instrument and expiry, which is called a long straddle or strangle. If the price moves up OR down significantly (causing losses on market makers) then the options will go out of money and simultaneously in the money at the same time, and at leverage on a deriviative one of them will be worth some serious money! While we&#8217;re happy to use Deribit for this, we&#8217;re excited to see a new player: Binance JEX, which supports options on many more types of underlyings. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f600.png" alt="ðŸ˜€" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f600.png" alt="ðŸ˜€" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p>What&#8217;s beautiful in the above screenshot (among other things&#8230;) is the dynamic leverage based on volatility. One can hedge using a fraction of the funds and balance one&#8217;s exposure with their hedging &#8211; and while the market maker makes money and the options lose money, we&#8217;re still smiling. When the market maker hits stoplosses and the options make money &#8211; we&#8217;re still laughing. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p>Everyone read this helpful article on <a href="https://www.hywel.me/static/site/wordpress/2016/07/17/fast-free-static-website-with-wordpress-and-github-pages.html">how to export static WordPress stuff to Github.io</a> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p>Works like a breeze except I don&#8217;t think you need to change your branch over, more info to come&#8230;</p>



<p>Now, a blog that won&#8217;t die in the fire of a series of unfortunate events like VPSs going down or a domain expiring. Hola! Hooah!</p>



<p>That&#8217;s it that&#8217;s all &#8211; for now, folks!</p>
