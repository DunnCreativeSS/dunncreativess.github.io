<h1>Microtipping: Future of Social Rewards?</h1>



<p>With a minimum BAT tip of 1 BAT, there&#8217;s been some discussion around the interwebs of instituting a custom # BAT tip.</p>



<p>This would allow, as one user mentioned, the ability to microtip a fraction of a BAT at the same time they save a tweet for later &#8211; which would benefit everyone. Whereas, at present, a whole BAT might not be sustainable for each time I&#8217;d want to share some love &#8211; a fraction of a BAT would.</p>



<p>With Uphold as the present custodial license for holding and transferring BAT and BAT rewards around the Brave ecosystem, does this work super easily &#8211; comparing it to microtipping BAT on the Ether blockchain? Is Uphold off-chain, allowing any number of smaller transactions? Would future custodial solutions that aren&#8217;t requiring KYC allowing us to also microtip in this fashion?</p>



<p>Microtipping (along with the ease of use of the Tip function on social sites that Brave allows) would restructure the way people use (and think about) social interaction online.</p>

<h1>Example of Driving BAT and Crypto Adoption thru Responding to LinkedIn Promotion (since removed by mods)</h1>



<p>Preface: Lisa was an outstanding connection request on LinkedIn I confirmed maybe 24 hrs ago. She has 10 mutual connections, and 500+ total.</p>



<ul><li>Hi, I am Lisa, Web Development Manager and I work with experienced IT professionals who are into: * Create a New Website * Redesign a website? * Website Design and Development * Update Your Existing Website * E-Commerce Solutions If you are interested, then I can send you our Price list, company information and an affordable quotation with the best offer. Sincerely, Lisa</li><li><strong>TODAY</strong>&nbsp;1:33 AM</li><li>We are really looking forward to receiving your answer so that we can get to any final conclusion Best Lisa<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f4f7.png" alt="ðŸ“·" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li><li>Jarett Dunn 12:30 PM</li><li>Hey, no thanks!</li><li><strong>Jarett Dunn</strong>&nbsp;12:34 PM</li><li>To drive revenues, you should let your website proprietors know above Brave browser and BAT:&nbsp;<a href="https://jare.cloud/2020/01/15/better-web-brave-rewards-your-content-make-money-monetizing-twitter" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><strong>https://jare.cloud/2020/01/15/better-web-brave-rewards-your-content-make-money-monetizing-twitter</strong></a>/ Since verifying myself as a Brave publisher a/o 4 days ago I&#8217;ve earned ~11 BAT ($2.20 USD) in donations to my different platforms. That might not seem like much, but for someone with a larger audience or following it can serve as an additional revenue stream. This is compared to my&nbsp;<a href="http://medium.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><strong>Medium.com</strong></a>&nbsp;earnings for the last ~12 days, at $1.80 USD.&nbsp; As a Brave affiliate you can also earn up to $7.50 USD for browser installations that remain installed after 30 days. Since putting up that Brave article that I linked you to, I have 7 downloads and 4 installs &#8211; this could yield up to $30 USD in affiliate income, over 4 days of referrals so far.</li></ul>

<p>Comment: I agree withÂ <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.reddit.com/u/O1O1O1O/" target="_blank">u/O1O1O1O</a>Â &#8211; because Brave rewards users with advertiser&#8217;s funds to then pay (or not..) their favorite content producers, then every user eventually has a BAT or a few to redistribute &#8211; and everyone wins. Brave also allows content creators/publishers of many times &#8211; theoretically any platform that includes an API where we can decide if one user&#8217;s view on a profile is for a specific other user. This discounts sites like Facebook, Minds, but is already beautifully connected on Twitter and here on Reddit. This is potentially far more views, far more publishers and far more ad spend than Medium.<br></p>

<p>In the next iteration of my 1st party ad service, I created Javascript code that randomly chooses one of two ads to display in the header of each of the pages on my blog. This Brave-friendly ad displays content about Brave or Publish0x. It also detects mobile displays and gives a smaller banner for mobile.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s genius in it&#8217;s simplicity. . . I half want to re-package this into a WordPress plugin for other Brave content creators on WP.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s some code:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>if (/Android|webOS|iPhone|iPad|iPod|BlackBerry|BB|PlayBook|IEMobile|Windows Phone|Kindle|Silk|Opera Mini/i.test(navigator.userAgent)) {

	var random = Math.random(1)

	if (random &lt; 0.5){

	$('#masthead').prepend('&lt;a href="&#91;https://jare.cloud/2020/01/15/better-web-brave-rewards-your-content-make-money-monetizing-twitter/](https://jare.cloud/2020/01/15/better-web-brave-rewards-your-content-make-money-monetizing-twitter/)">&lt;img src="&#91;https://jare.cloud/468.png](https://jare.cloud/468.png)" />&lt;/a>')

<p>Interested in a way to utilize Crypto Pump n Dump tweets &#8211; for fun &amp; profit? <a href="https://jare.cloud/2020/01/15/automated-crypto-trading-bot-to-buy-pump-and-dump-sentiment-signals-from-twitter/">Check out this article I wrote on making mad stacks on Twitter sentiment</a>!</p>



<h2>Day 1</h2>



<p>I had a thought: if some of my traffic comes from Twitter to Medium and my blog, wouldn&#8217;t I want to maximize this &#8211; in a hands-free fashion? I&#8217;ve done this before &#8211; some of my accounts had 5k+ followers in a few months. I had bought a Google sheets templated sheet doc with Twitter integrations, and bam it flew. I later created a Github repo for a hackathon starter fork where I put in all these juicey follow, retweet, favorite logics into a prettier UI.</p>



<p>The benefit of the hackathon starter is that I can login via oauth &#8211; meaning the app has api keys, but the user does not. We&#8217;re all used to oauth login &#8211; do you want to login using gmail/facebook/twitter? Redirect to platform, redirect to site, success!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-21.png" alt="" class="wp-image-236" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-21.png 876w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-21-300x245.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-21-768x627.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 876px) 100vw, 876px" /></figure>



<p>I resurrected my gsheet today and started the magic. I made some edits to the code: specifically we want to follow, retweet and favorite. Hooah!</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s set our benchmark&#8230;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-20-1024x303.png" alt="" class="wp-image-235" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-20-1024x303.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-20-300x89.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-20-768x227.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-20.png 1032w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2>Day 2</h2>



<p>Well, we have some initial results! Twitter app on my phone has been blowing up. Let&#8217;s analyze the results so far&#8230;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-22.png" alt="" class="wp-image-237" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-22.png 1009w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-22-300x98.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-22-768x250.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1009px) 100vw, 1009px" /></figure>



<p>We&#8217;ve gained 13 followers in 24 hours! That might not sound like much, but it&#8217;s a full 10.8% increase over where we were. Even better than that, the amount of followers vs the amount of people I&#8217;ve followed &#8211; an important metric on Twitter &#8211; has actually increased! </p>



<p>I did notice that the UI on Twitter wouldn&#8217;t let me follow people. This is dangerous, as if we try to follow too many people and get errors because our account is limited, Twitter may ban the account. We remove the follow directives, and increase retweets and likes.</p>



<h2>Day 3</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-23-1024x364.png" alt="" class="wp-image-238" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-23-1024x364.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-23-300x107.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-23-768x273.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-23.png 1048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Wow! A further 12% increase in followers! Our ratio increased again, too. That&#8217;s fantastic news&#8230; I&#8217;m greedy now, and so I&#8217;m going to increase the retweets and favorites from one per search term per hour up to 3. This should accelerate this monster&#8230; let&#8217;s wait and find out!</p>



<p>UPDATE: 3/4 the way through Day 3, let&#8217;s take a look at results. Just because I hate waiting. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-24.png" alt="" class="wp-image-239" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-24.png 977w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-24-300x119.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-24-768x306.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 977px) 100vw, 977px" /></figure>



<p>Well, that strategy appears to be working! No longer is my account limited, and also my followers increased a further 12% on top of the last 12% and 10% &#8211; an increase in rate. When we check in in another 6ish hours we&#8217;ll hopefully see that the data for the 18th reflect a massive increase.</p>



<p>What&#8217;s even better is that my follower vs followed ratio is increasing SIGNIFICANTLY. Because I&#8217;m no longer following people using the bot &#8211; although I did some manually, messing up stats &#8211; this ratio is now EXPLODING. </p>



<p>Twitter limits your ability to follow new people after you follow 5k, and if this ratio is too too deep then everyone will assume you&#8217;re digging for followers and your rate of follow backs will decrease. D&#8217;oh!</p>



<h2>Day 4</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-33-1024x761.png" alt="" class="wp-image-295" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-33-1024x761.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-33-300x223.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-33-768x571.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-33.png 1045w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Twitter: Free Money</figcaption></figure>



<p>Social traffic and engagements are literally free money if you monetize your visitors in any way, or put a dollar value on them.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-48-1024x249.png" alt="" class="wp-image-339" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-48-1024x249.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-48-300x73.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-48-768x187.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-48.png 1050w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Plus &#8211; we&#8217;ve seen a massive increase in both followers and the ratio! Booya!</p>



<h2>Day 5</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-49-1024x259.png" alt="" class="wp-image-340" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-49-1024x259.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-49-300x76.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-49-768x194.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-49.png 1035w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The followers and ratio continue their upwards trend, although slowing down&#8230;</p>



<h2>Day 6</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-50-1024x285.png" alt="" class="wp-image-341" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-50-1024x285.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-50-300x84.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-50-768x214.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-50.png 1041w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Oh! I know why my followed is still trending up. My code had a hard-coded &#8216;followback&#8217; feature. Let&#8217;s turn that off!</p>



<h2>Day 7</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-51-1024x680.png" alt="" class="wp-image-342" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-51-1024x680.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-51-300x199.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-51-768x510.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-51-120x80.png 120w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-51.png 1035w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Looking good&#8230;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-52.png" alt="" class="wp-image-343" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-52.png 1022w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-52-300x97.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-52-768x248.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1022px) 100vw, 1022px" /></figure>



<p>We&#8217;ve now accomplished the 2nd-highest daily increase in % follower/followed ratio. Hooah!</p>



<p>That concludes our 7-day adventure into automating Twitter engagements, for fun and profit. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-53.png" alt="" class="wp-image-344" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-53.png 337w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-53-300x87.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 337px) 100vw, 337px" /></figure>



<p>We&#8217;ve seen an 85% increase &#8211; nearly double! In followers over 7 days, and 30% increase in follower/followed ratio. These are huge numbers, indicative of a healthy and growing Twitter following.</p>

<p> <a href="https://jare.cloud/2020/01/20/publish0x-allowing-rewards-for-content-with-their-own-funds-re-distribution-of-wealth-defined/">View this article in it&#8217;s original form on jare.cloud</a>! </p>

<p>As one of my first ads delivered through the Brave browser was for Publish0x, I had originally been quick to dismiss it. On later inspection &#8211; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BATProject/comments/er28xp/i_havent_sent_any_bat_but_theres_a_disconnect/">when I figured out I could 2.5x my BAT rewards by switching my Brave Rewards from 2 ads/hr to 5</a> &#8211; I found I could earn BAT and DAI for blogging&#8230; or reading!&#8230; my favorite content on their platform.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-43.png" alt="" class="wp-image-328" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-43.png 965w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-43-300x160.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-43-768x411.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 965px) 100vw, 965px" /></figure>



<p>This, together with syndication for my blog and juicey backlinks, allowed me to quickly sign up and find that indeed &#8211; I was able to tip every few minutes and choose what % of that tip I wanted to keep for myself.</p>



<p>Win-win-win! The money comes from their big ol&#8217; community chest of possible rewards, spanning many coins.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-44-1024x259.png" alt="" class="wp-image-329" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-44-1024x259.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-44-300x76.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-44-768x195.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-44.png 1042w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>

<p>In such a way, I&#8217;ve earned BAT, HYDRO and DAI already on the platform &#8211; by voting on 4 articles. Genius!</p>



<p>This is the definition of redistribution of wealth. The communist&#8217;s dream, in a capitalist application!</p>



<p>Hint: they also sport a fancy Ambassador program &#8211; allowing you, too, &#8216;Earn&nbsp;<strong>5%</strong>&nbsp;of every tip generated by your referrals using the tipper at the bottom of each article. This includes both the tip to the author and the amount claimed by your referral.&#8217;</p>

<p>Check it out! My buddy signed up and tipped a writer.. and I earned, before I even finished this promotional post! That&#8217;s free money begetting free money.

<h2>Introduction-ar-ily </h2>



<p>In order to both survive and thrive we need to take everything with a grain of salt, celebrate the small things and get through the small stuff. 12 Step programs are keen on &#8216;one day at a time,&#8217; but I want to offer up the only two strategies you&#8217;ll need in life (and I thank my mom for these bits of wisdom):</p>



<p>This Too Shall Pass and Onwards and Upwards</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://imgc.artprintimages.com/img/print/this-too-shall-pass_u-l-f7wkq40.jpg?h=550&amp;p=0&amp;w=550&amp;background=fbfbfb" alt="Image result for this too shall pass"/></figure>



<h2>Downs</h2>



<p>If you feel incredibly down, in a valley in the peaks and valleys sense, or a depression in the bipolar sense &#8211; <a href="https://jare.cloud/2020/01/15/why-schizophrenia-is-the-most-under-represented-of-all-the-death-sentences/">read all about the plights of mental health woes here in another article of mine</a> &#8211; it&#8217;s most important to remember these two mantras. Sometimes the world deals us blow after blow, and it might be the worst few months you&#8217;ve ever faced &#8211; you might have lost a friend or a loved one, or a job or a prospect. Whatever the reason, how we cope with these kinds of situations helps define us as a person &#8211; without the struggle, we&#8217;d never appreciate the good that comes our way with as much of our hearts as we do.</p>



<p>This Too Shall Pass teaches us that no matter how bad it gets and no matter how bleak it might seem, there&#8217;s only up from here to go. It reminds us that we&#8217;ve been through worse &#8211; and we survived. We&#8217;re strong people, and even in the worst-case scenario we can always remember some other kind of time or even compare our experiences to those we see in media or read in books. People have gotten through these traumas.. so can you. It&#8217;s not meant to belittle or take away from your pain, but give you some solace in knowing that recovery is possible. You got this!</p>



<p>Onwards and Upwards teaches us to continue putting in the effort in order to see better manifest itself in our lives. Keep trying. Keep on swimming. We must be the masters of our own destinies and fates &#8211; leaving it up to The Powers that Be (your God, her Shiva and my Science) is taking the backseat and back burner to our own lives. You have to be the mastermind and the architect, the engineer and the manual labor in effecting your own change. Nobody else will do it for you. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://i.pinimg.com/474x/0f/fd/c4/0ffdc46102b89a9ad0bfaa9eac4daf30--narnia-balloon.jpg" alt="Image result for onwards and upwards"/></figure>



<h2> Ups</h2>



<p>What can these mantras tell us about how we should react to the mountains, as opposed to the peaks? The euphoria or mania that we sometimes experience when things are looking up? Sometimes we might get taken away by the rollercoaster of emotion that happen to us in the most joyous of times &#8211; whether it be Christmas, a new baby, graduating medical school or just an unbalanced amount of chemicals in your brain along with misfiring neurons. Whatever the reason, these sayings are just as powerful now as they were in our lowest of lows.</p>



<p>This Too Shall Pass lets us know that we can always expect the buzz and elation to eventually go away &#8211; and to prepare ourselves for more battles at a later date. It&#8217;s not meant to take away from the joy we&#8217;re experiencing, but rather to give us a sobering look at how to prepare for the coming days. We can always enjoy ourselves &#8211; and thoroughly &#8211; while still being ready for the future. An excellent example is in the honeymoon stage of new relationships: most of us have felt it, and some of us have ended up in a world of hurt once the pheromones wore out. What&#8217;s the lesson? Always have a steady head and try to remember the consequences of our actions and decisions, even if they were seen in a different light &#8211; by a later you, by your friends or family, or by society at large.</p>



<p>And when we think of Onwards and Upwards, we can remember that &#8211; on a scale approaching infinity &#8211; there is actually no limit to the amounts of joy and success we can fit into a day. When things are going super well it&#8217;s best to build on that momentum and see if we can make it even better, achieve more things or invigorate ourselves to do more, see more, be more than if we didn&#8217;t have that extra motivation. This allows us to keep pushing forward &#8211; as masters of our own success &#8211; and build the building blocks of a better, safer, happier future. Even if we consider the eventual trough or downturn in our internal state, we can lay the foundation and plant the seeds of further wealth, happiness and prosperity the next time we&#8217;re back on our uppers. </p>



<h2>Finally</h2>



<p>Remember &#8211; you are the master of the universe. You are the commander of your destiny. You are the sole reason you&#8217;re still here, and the sole reason you should keep on moving forward. This might be contrary to some of your beliefs, but at least try to read it and apply it in a way that works with what you believe to be true &#8211; the more active you are in your own life and your own situation, the more effect you&#8217;ll have &#8211; and the more of what you want will manifest. You can attribute these changes where you like!</p>

<p><a href="https://jare.cloud/2020/01/19/nexo-review-for-crypto-loans-and-bitcoin-loans-and-crypto-cards-mco-visa-tenx-too/">View this article in itâ€™s original form on jare.cloud</a>!</p>



<h2>Intro</h2>



<p>What if Nexo had more than $100m USD worth of YOUR assets? More than their centralized bank-backed insurance fund protects?</p>



<p>What if Nexo began speculatively investing YOUR funds into third-party protocols, putting the capital at risk &#8211; or even losing substantial amounts of it?</p>



<p>What if Nexo, Monaco (MCO) or TenX bailed with all your funds &#8211; in massive exit scams the likes of which we have indeed seen before, at Mt. Gox or QuadrigaCX?</p>



<p>What are the alternatives for collateralized loans &#8211; where can we hedge our crypto assets, using Bitcoin or Ether or other underlyings to draw tax-friendly income? </p>



<p>Read on&#8230;</p>



<h2>Centralized Off-Chain Crypto Interest on Holdings &#8211; and Collateralized Loans Against Crypto &#8211; Seems Like a Great Idea</h2>



<p>While Nexo and Nexo clones offer some great incentives to help you feel safe &amp; secure handing over your hard-earned crypto, like a $100 million insurance fund or tax-friendly income while not spending your assets &#8211; there are huge pitfalls to trusting The Man with your units of value&#8230; with YOUR money.</p>



<p>Sure, someone may be in the position where they hold 1 BTC and want to earn a % of that 1 BTC back from an organization while doing absolutely nothing. Seems risk-free, right? &#8216;Compound your crypto&#8217; is a popular sentiment on the Internet of late &#8211; I even <a href="https://twitter.com/jarettdunn">use that phrase in my twitter bio</a>. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-34.png" alt="" class="wp-image-306" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-34.png 996w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-34-300x78.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-34-768x200.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 996px) 100vw, 996px" /></figure>



<p>What does it mean, in actual effect?</p>



<p>Well, if I have 1 BTC now and that BTC earns me 8% APR &#8211; each and every year &#8211; that 8% will earn another 8% on the 8% in year 2. </p>



<p>If we&#8217;re also long BTC, or think it&#8217;ll grow at, say, 5% average per year in value, then our resulting investment would look like this:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-35-1024x303.png" alt="" class="wp-image-307" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-35-1024x303.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-35-300x89.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-35-768x227.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-35.png 1377w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>After 10 years your BTC has nearly doubled, and the value of that BTC is up 112x&#8230;.</p>



<p>That seems to be fantastic, right? And a 5% growth on BTC per year is rather.. well, conservative, right?</p>



<h2>Other Side of That Coin</h2>



<p>Say we&#8217;re even more long on a bullish BTC, and think it&#8217;ll rise in value by &#8211; say &#8211; 30% per year. Now, we can look at Nexo or other centralized bank-backed solutions to lend US Dollar against our asset. I&#8217;m risk averse to clicking on their site, but I imagine their rates are maybe 10-14% APR. So, we lend the max. amount against our BTC at around $4500 USD, and pay 14% on the loan &#8211; while our BTC appreciates 30%.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s what that math looks like:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-36-1024x334.png" alt="" class="wp-image-308" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-36-1024x334.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-36-300x98.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-36-768x250.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-36.png 1313w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>All else remaining equal, shortly after 6 years we have ALL of our bitcoin back in appreciated value vs what we owe on our loan. </p>



<p>Let&#8217;s go even more bullish BTC &#8211; think The Halvening will grow BTC to $12k, then it&#8217;s a clear road to $20k, then moon? So do I!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-37-1024x334.png" alt="" class="wp-image-309" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-37-1024x334.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-37-300x98.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-37-768x250.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-37.png 1313w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>If BTC grows 230% in a calendar year, we effectively have a free half BTC in loaned amount in less than a year. That&#8217;s fantastic! Free money!</p>



<h2>Now, the Catch</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-38.png" alt="" class="wp-image-310" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-38.png 728w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-38-300x84.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /></figure>



<p>I wonder if Nexo has overgrown their little insurance scheme? I wonder if too many people have trusted something too good to be true &#8211; in the hands of a select few, a legal entity, and human fallacies?</p>



<p>Even more sinister, let&#8217;s say Nexo was sitting on millions of dollars in Ether. Let&#8217;s say they thought &#8211; nay, they bet on the idea &#8211; that Ether would never ever possibly depreciate past $300. Long Live Ether, right? Now, they use a third party protocol to lend against their Ether bankroll &#8211; to the tune of millions $ USD &#8211; to boost their coffers and all their marketing campaigns to draw more people into their massive &#8216;insured&#8217; ponzi. </p>



<p>Then, as we witnessed, Eth did go down. Way. Past. $300.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-39-1024x473.png" alt="" class="wp-image-311" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-39-1024x473.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-39-300x139.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-39-768x355.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-39.png 1343w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-40-1024x627.png" alt="" class="wp-image-312" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-40-1024x627.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-40-300x184.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-40-768x470.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-40.png 1077w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-41.png" alt="" class="wp-image-313" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-41.png 916w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-41-300x216.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-41-768x552.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 916px) 100vw, 916px" /></figure>



<p>Can you think of anything more sinister&#8230; than risking people&#8217;s funds they trust your insurance to cover, then losing it? </p>



<p>Trust the banks to mess with you like this.</p>



<p>Trust custodial solutions to mess with your hard-earned cash.</p>



<h2>Monaco&#8217;s Visa Card, TenX, Populous, and the Others</h2>



<p>Nexo has another product in the pipes: a crypto-loans backed credit/debit card. When you put your crypto onto a debit/credit card, you&#8217;re actually just giving it to banks to hold onto &#8211; and with that, you&#8217;re giving them all of your personally identifiable information, as well as the right to track you and sell your data to the highest bidder (and all the other bidders with half a dollar). What this means is that you&#8217;re taking the ultimate grassroots revolution against banks and the richest 1% and giving it right back to them. This goes against everything Satoshi and all the other crypto revolutionaries had wanted with their digital cash. Do Your Own Research, and decide what&#8217;s right.</p>



<p>Moreover, existing crypto card solutions like cryptopay.me and xapo all lost their licenses for dealing with North America and loads of other places &#8211; because banks, by and large, don&#8217;t trust crypto. </p>



<p>If you need to spend your crypto look to solutions like localbitcoins.com &#8211; where you can even sell your BTC at around 1% on the dollar value to meet in person and get cold, hard cash.</p>



<h2>The Solution</h2>



<p>Never, ever trust custodial solutions! There&#8217;s such a thing as counter-party risk that&#8217;s well documented, and this is why decentralized exchanges and decentralized finance are winning with a clear advantage &#8211; employing trustless solutions where people are interacting with a tech protocol rather than an organization, person, people, or &#8211; worse yet &#8211; a bank.</p>



<p>Solutions are abound: check <a href="https://jare.cloud/2020/01/14/top-money-making-decentralized-finance-defi-applications/">my article comparing the top 6-8 decentralized finance protocols</a>.</p>



<p>Of these, a few come to mind for compounding your crypto: like <a href="https://compound.finance/">compound.finance</a>, where you can earn interest on your cryptos while holding them in your own damned wallet, secured by your own damned keys. This completely removes the counter-party risk of earning on your crypto. Almost all the other solutions in the above article like <a href="http://nuo.network/">nuo.network</a> or <a href="http://fulcrum.trade/">fulcrum.trade</a> allow you to earn, too, sometimes at higher rates &#8211; and aggregators exist, too, like <a href="http://staked.us/?pid=fr5BC09Vgc">staked.us&#8217;s Robo Advisor for Yield</a> which allows you to passively rebalance your lent portfolio.</p>



<p>Compound also allows you to borrow against your crypto assets &#8211; all on-chain, all non-custodial. You own your own keys. You can receive a number of stablecoins for your Ether or other tokens, or even borrow against non-stable assets &#8211; the choice is yours to long or short whatever you like. </p>



<p>They currently don&#8217;t support borrowing against BTC or the BTC-backed Wrapped BTC (WBTC), but have no fear! Fulcrum.trade has a sister-site powered by the same protocol <a href="https://torque.loans/">https://torque.loans/</a>  where &#8211; at present &#8211; you can get $4800 in stablecoins for your 1 WBTC.</p>

<h2>The Verdict</h2>



<p>Never, ever trust The Man with your money. That&#8217;s the point of Blockchain. Banks, governments will collapse and fail, the ATMs will stop giving you money and gas will stop being delivered to your favorite gas stations &#8211; food will stop being delivered to your supermarkets &#8211; but crypto will not fail because the protocols are run without the interference or governance of man (or woman, or other).</p>

<p>Fomo3D was a dangerous game theory that was then applied, obfuscated, and raked in a sh#tton of cold, hard cash.</p>



<p>Users would sign up for <a href="https://exitscam.me/">https://exitscam.me/</a> and play the game. Their greed would ensure they always spent more than they lost in an auction that Harvard Business School teaches their pupils &#8211; it&#8217;s called a &#8216;War of Attrition.&#8217;</p>



<p>When offered the chance to bid on a $20 bill with $1, people will bid on it. The problem is this: the 2nd highest bid also has to pay whenever the winner is chosen. So, when the bid is $19 and the prize is $20, someone will surely bid to make a dollar. Now, when you&#8217;re the $18 bid you might lose your $18 if you don&#8217;t bid again &#8211; paying $20 for $20. If you win, you&#8217;re down $0. If you don&#8217;t bid, and lose now, you&#8217;re down $18. </p>



<p>What&#8217;s the person with the $19 bid do?</p>



<p>There&#8217;s been documented cases where the bidding reached a walloping $4000 &#8211; in a display of sheer ego. The loser was caught up in the ecstasy of playing the game.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s exactly what Fomo3D did, except the winnings were divvied up in a very smart way that wasn&#8217;t previously available to the general public: using an underlying dividend-paying or burning token (forget which) they cleverly increased the token value or delivered payments for token holders when people played the game.</p>



<p>This caused a huge social effort by token holders &#8211; and game players &#8211; to spread FOMO about the game around the internet. This would bring in new players and &#8211; occasionally &#8211; those who would even win or lose by ego, or win or lose because of the sheer thrill of the game.</p>



<p>Learning all of this tonight for the first time, I did a brief Google on &#8216;dangerous game theory&#8217; and was actually learning about game theory for the first time in my life. Now, this shit is fun. And profitable.</p>



<p>I read about War of Attrition. What a beautiful concept. </p>



<p>The wikipedia article linked to a few other sources: Chicken, another dangerous game theory, has a fancy theory name &#8211; but it&#8217;s still chicken. When one veers off they lose, when both collide they both lose. We&#8217;ll examine opportunities here at a later date, but I also came across another interesting concept.</p>



<p>The prisoner&#8217;s dilemma is that two guys are caught for selling drugs, and both are facing 2 years for sure. The feds think they&#8217;re both involved in a much more serious crime, and tell Prisoner A that he&#8217;ll get 3 years if they both confess &#8211; but if he confesses, and Prisoner B doesn&#8217;t, he&#8217;ll get 1 year and Prisoner B will get 10. Now, if he denies and Prisoner B confesses, then he will get 10 years and Prisoner B will get 1 year.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-25.png" alt="" class="wp-image-242" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-25.png 645w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-25-300x84.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 645px) 100vw, 645px" /></figure>



<p>What the feds don&#8217;t mention is the final outcome: if they both deny, they&#8217;re both faced with 2 years. This is what&#8217;s referred to as the &#8216;globally optimal solution&#8217; &#8211; meaning that if I was able to talk to the other prisoner we might both deny.</p>



<p>What&#8217;s in my best interest, as Prisoner 1?</p>



<p>Well, it looks as though no matter what I do &#8211; without knowing the other party&#8217;s intentions &#8211; confessing is my best option. I either face 1 year &#8211; which is great &#8211; or three years. However, I&#8217;m completely avoiding the possibility that I might get 10 years &#8211; which is the worst-case scenario. Both of us confessing isn&#8217;t the best optimal answer on the board, but it&#8217;s what&#8217;s best without knowing the other party&#8217;s intentions &#8211; we call this the Nash Equilibrium, after famous mathematician John Nash. This is applied extensively to playing poker &#8211; where it applies just as much. </p>



<p>Nash was also one of the most famous schizophrenics, and the subject of the movie A Beautiful Mind. Want to read more about how people with schizophrenia think? <a href="https://jare.cloud/2020/01/14/how-do-people-with-mental-health-illnesses-like-schizophrenia-or-other-psychoses-think/">Check out this article I wrote on psychotic thoughts</a> (from first-hand experience!)</p>



<p>Now, if we flip these numbers to their inverse and do some jiggery pokery, we can come up with a profitable business idea for anyone to rake in huge amounts of capital from tokensales and giving people the opportunity to have fun &#8211; and potentially win big.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-27.png" alt="" class="wp-image-244" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-27.png 658w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-27-300x83.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 658px) 100vw, 658px" /></figure>



<p>Say my risk is that I might lose all of my 2 Ether deposit on betting in this game. The funds are locked in smart contract. If I go with Option 2, there&#8217;s a chance that I could lose my whole balance or there&#8217;s a chance I might get 1.7 of my ether back. OK, good enough.</p>



<p>If I choose Option 1, there&#8217;s a chance I get 1.3 of my Ether back or &#8211; here&#8217;s the kicker &#8211; I might get 2.3 of my ether back (and &#8216;win&#8217;) should Player 2 choose option 2.</p>



<p>Logic would say that a rational person wants their chance at winning, and will always go with Option 1. Whereas, if both players do, then they both lose. Right?</p>



<p>So far this isn&#8217;t very promising as a dangerous game.</p>



<p>However, enter an oraclized call to a random number generator choosing 50/50 either option 1 or option 2, as player 2. Sure, this player would need to put funds up first in order to play &#8211; which might come from project funds or from tokenholders putting up the funds against people that lock up Eth in a contract &#8211; but check this out, here&#8217;s what would happen in Game 1:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-28-1024x154.png" alt="" class="wp-image-245" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-28-1024x154.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-28-300x45.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-28-768x115.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-28-1536x231.png 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-28.png 1750w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Player 1 will always (rationally) choose option 1. The RNG chooses 50/50 options 1 or 2. In green/yellow are the possible outcomes for player 1: they either get 1.3 Ether if they lose, or 2.3 ether if they win. Now, no rational GAMBLER would play these odds &#8211; but, keep listening! There&#8217;s a 50% chance that the pot wins 0.7 Ether, and a 50% chance it loses 0.3 Ether. Fair enough, so averaging out our winnings that&#8217;s 0.2 Ether.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m going to take this Ether and add half to the game pot. The other half I&#8217;m going to use to give value to my game token &#8211; by buy n burn or dividends.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s look what happens in Game 2:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-29-1024x123.png" alt="" class="wp-image-246" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-29-1024x123.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-29-300x36.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-29-768x92.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-29-1536x184.png 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-29.png 1743w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Now we&#8217;re talking, we&#8217;ve sweetened the pot that the Player has a 50/50 chance of winning &#8211; with half the house&#8217;s winnings from each game before that reinvested back into the pot. There&#8217;s a chance they win &#8211; and pot doesn&#8217;t increase, no new token burn or dividends happen. There&#8217;s half a chance they lose again &#8211; and it&#8217;s added to the pot and increases the value of the token.</p>



<p>Etc etc tending towards infinity, the potential winnings for playing the game increase ever so much while they&#8217;re still losing 1/2 the time playing against the evil supercomputer. </p>



<p>3rd game? More money to be won! Eventually, the gambler&#8217;s odds increase enough to be a worthwhile bet no matter what &#8211; and the token&#8217;s value continues to increase with each average result of the game. This creates a frenzy of people spreading news about the game, drawing more and more people and money into the game.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-30-1024x124.png" alt="" class="wp-image-247" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-30-1024x124.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-30-300x36.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-30-768x93.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-30-1536x186.png 1536w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-30.png 1730w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>What does this mean for me, penning this article? Even though I don&#8217;t have a smart contract developer or a budget, at least now I own the Intellectual Property on this new evolution of a Dangerous Game Theory smart contract game. If you are a smart contract developer and would like to team up, let me know! If I&#8217;ve made any critical errors in my math &#8211; it wouldn&#8217;t be the first time! Let me know!</p>



<p>Now that we&#8217;ve talked about having the benefits of those with beautiful minds &#8211; <a href="https://jare.cloud/2020/01/15/why-schizophrenia-is-the-most-under-represented-of-all-the-death-sentences/">let&#8217;s talk about the challenges schizophrenics face</a>, in this article I wrote!</p>

<p> Join our growing Telegram community for blog updates, bot chat, general fun and crypto madness? <a href="https://t.me/ManyVolumeSignalMonster">https://t.me/ManyVolumeSignalMonster</a> </p>



<h2>#1: You&#8217;ll Always be Pleasantly Surprised</h2>



<p>This is actually a secret my mom taught me over and over again. If you expect the worst possible outcome in any given situation &#8211; love, relationships, family, work &#8211; then whatever does come to pass will certainly be better than your expectations!</p>



<p>In such a way, you&#8217;ll find little joys throughout your day and week. These little joys will create a sense of reward that you might not have had if you were constantly being let down by your own expectations.</p>



<p>Framing your world in a different light can have certain advantages &#8211; for those with very specific minds, you might lose touch with the &#8216;real reality&#8217; and become a concern for your own self&#8217;s well-being. Read an article I wrote on how <a href="https://jare.cloud/2020/01/14/how-do-people-with-mental-health-illnesses-like-schizophrenia-or-other-psychoses-think/">people with schizophrenia and mental health can actually think</a> (from first-hand experience).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/2118/2511788463_03d9281e2e_z.jpg" alt="Image result for pleasant surprise"/></figure>



<h2>#2: Emergency Preparedness Saves Lives</h2>



<p>In a much more literal sense, being prepared for the worst will mean that you create disaster recovery plans &#8211; be they for the zombie apocalypse, should your car die and need repairs you can&#8217;t immediately afford, or if the lights go out for a day or two &#8211; having a plan improves your chances of getting through the scenario measurably. </p>



<p>This is so true that a brief Google search returns many millions islands (results, in Google English Pirate language) for &#8217;emergency preparedness course,&#8217; <a href="https://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/aclk?sa=L&amp;ai=DChcSEwjL39ilpYvnAhVN1sAKHex_BzcYABAAGgJpbQ&amp;ohost=www.google.com&amp;cid=CAESQOD2M1X01icn_Ddsj9d_VtuSw2OJzkWb-hMqPuHbRQdhjHlW1fmxM4R73TFopbDePIk6WevtDEoZfVqZPTnors0&amp;sig=AOD64_0WZlRmA4DrGAF_Av58ZgcPrRp7aA&amp;q=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwixoc2lpYvnAhXFWc0KHTQqBxIQ0Qx6BAgQEAE&amp;adurl=">like this one at a Canadian university</a>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-19-1024x696.png" alt="" class="wp-image-231" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-19-1024x696.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-19-300x204.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-19-768x522.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-19.png 1178w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2>#3: You&#8217;ll Be Ready for Anything</h2>



<p>Hand in hand with being prepared for the worst-case scenario, you&#8217;ll also be ready for all the other scenarios up and down the range of possible outcomes &#8211; from the best possible ones right down to what could potentially be the absolute worst. Because you have considered and somehow either counted or discounted each possible route, you will have a plan for accomplishing things regardless of how fate will twist your arm. </p>



<p>As you get more and more used to this mental exercise, you&#8217;ll notice that your breadth of perception will naturally expand &#8211; as you&#8217;ll be considering more &#8216;twists of fate,&#8217; having added personal experience and the nature of the universe as it tends towards infinity. What I mean to say, rather, is that as the Powers That Be (whatever you subscribe to) throw new and unexpected curveballs your way, your brain will naturally plan for even more possibilities and outcomes. This will expand your mind way better than the hippie in highschool promised you Lysergic Acid Diethylamide ever could have come close to.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e83b3f710949ba6d82614821d6d3f93dd1786b9/0_1020_3125_1875/master/3125.jpg?width=300&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=7fd40712c4db8af6b93a0ab9580243a9" alt="Image result for lsd"/></figure>



<h2>#4: You&#8217;ll Achieve More Goals</h2>



<p>Well, #3 was a bit of a doublethink mindfuck. What does it translate to, practically? Why should it be encouraging, rather than something to be afraid of?</p>



<p>In reality, creating new and interesting ways to approach problems will give you new and novel ways of conquering those problems. Your new disaster emergency preparedness attitude &#8211; when applied to everything &#8211; will allow you to accomplish more and more of your goals, more and more frequently. </p>



<p>This has a fantastic effect on your mindset, and overall happiness. If you do end up doing the things you set out to do more often than you do now, or even in fashions you hadn&#8217;t considered before, then you&#8217;ll have more and more dopamine for your pleasure centers &#8211; which means a happier, healthier you!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://images.saba.com/uploads/blog/what-should-you-do-when-you-dont-accomplish-your-goals/what-should-you-do-when-you-dont-accomplish-your-goals.jpg?s=1696x900" alt="Image result for accomplish"/></figure>



<h2>Bonus: Win Friends and Influence Enemies</h2>



<p>With a happier, healthier you comes a number of bonus effects &#8211; like a boost in charisma, confidence, ability. This truly is a snowball effect of positive outcomes.</p>



<p>When you present yourself better &#8211; or at least, more confidently &#8211; it results in people taking you more seriously, or appreciating you (or at least, your opinions and voice) more and more. This will allow you to gain more traction at work, home, and play. </p>



<p>It will allow you to harness your new-found powers of persuasion in two important ways. First, you&#8217;ll be able to befriend more people more frequently &#8211; winning their approval and allowing them to become proponents of whatever causes or values you subscribe to. Second, you&#8217;ll be able to exert your newfound influence over people who might detract from your causes or values &#8211; allowing you to gain more of a say over the people who would do you ill or harm (even just on the theoretical, intellectual level).</p>



<p>Did I interest you already about the ways in which a segregated, compartmentalized mindset can be a blessing &#8211; and a curse? <a href="https://jare.cloud/2020/01/15/why-schizophrenia-is-the-most-under-represented-of-all-the-death-sentences/">Read my other article here on how schizophrenia increases your chances of an early end to your mortal turmoil</a> (read again: it&#8217;s a fatal diagnosis. No, no joke!)</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Ad%2BUal74L.jpg" alt="Image result for win friends influence people"/></figure>



<h2>Bonus (Voice of Reason!) #2: This Is Actually a Lot of Work</h2>



<p>When you&#8217;re tasking your mind with so much data to consume and analyze, you&#8217;re actually spending a lot more time thinking about yourself and your surroundings, experiences and misconceptions an awful lot more than you are should you not be exercising this theory. This can translate to an awful lot of work &#8211; something that might end up tasking you to a point where it can do more harm than good.</p>



<p>Truly, if you become preoccupied by this exercise and it gets in the way of goals rather than helping them &#8211; or prevents you from performing at work, home, school, or anywhere &#8211; then it might not be worth the time that goes into it. As with anything, it&#8217;s good in moderation &#8211; and we should always exercise a good balance in our own minds.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>



<p>There&#8217;s nothing more enjoyable than trading for a living. You basically sit there, and exchange money for other things of value and then back again. Rinse wash  repeat, and you can certainly support yourself taking small profits every so often &#8211; or heavier ones, usually less often!</p>



<p>Eventually, all traders will settle into a routine they&#8217;re comfortable with. They&#8217;ll build up an overall strategy of smaller strategies ranging in complexity and different input variables &#8211; from indicators to position sizing, there&#8217;s a lot to consider!</p>



<p>What&#8217;s important is that it&#8217;s easy to make a day&#8217;s salary in one trade, with very little investment. It&#8217;s also easy &#8211; probably easier &#8211; to lose your entire nest egg in that same day. Remember, invest only what you can afford to lose!</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s discuss a bit about the history of consumer-level trade bots, how trade bots can be used by near-infinite amounts of money by institutions, and how we can make money today using trading bots!</p>



<h2>Historical Trade Bots: Expert Advisors</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://media.fxcm.com/fxpress/fxcmcom/base/page/metatrader-4/carousel-image-1.jpg?fit=cover&amp;auto=webp" alt="Image result for mt4"/></figure>



<p>Most consumer-level brokers over recent years have offered a universal integration for people to day-trade: it&#8217;s called MetaTrader, and most popular of the versions is MetaTrader 4. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://forexmt4ea.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/fdiamond_real_latest2.png" alt="Image result for mt4 ea"/></figure>



<p>It included all sorts of handy features, and could trade anything you could imagine &#8211; from stocks and deriviatives to commodities and forex, it was easy to win or lose quickly and with a laugh or a tear. </p>



<p>One of the most important features you could find was the Expert Advisor. What this was was a way for users &#8211; or developer shops &#8211; to program their own strategies into the machine, allowing it to trade automagically. Even when you were away to the Caribbean or when you were sleeping &#8211; and markets were open &#8211; the expert advisor code would be watching, and reacting to the markets. </p>



<p>You could use all sorts of indicators &#8211; like directional ones like RSI, price ones like VWAP, volatility ones like EWMA, and the list goes on &#8211; and your own variables to manipulate the info and act on your strategies.</p>



<p>This bred a whole new world where people could show off or even sell their Expert Advisors to other people. This marketplace was soon fraught with scams and genuine people trying to help out &#8211; like any other capitalist venue, it&#8217;s as important now as then to always Do Your Own Research before committing funds to anything.</p>



<p>One popular scam was to employ a version of the Martingale Betting System. What this means is that when you lose a bet (or a trade), you double (or increase) your risk so then when you win the next bet (or trade) you earn back everything you lost plus a little extra that you&#8217;ve just now won. Then, when you bet again you start with the base amount again (or less, anyhow) and repeat the process.</p>



<p>This sounds genius &#8211; you&#8217;ll never lose!</p>



<p>In reality, probability works against you and the longer you play this game the more likely it is that you&#8217;ll see a large enough streak of losses to wipe out all your earnings. Neigh, even nations would lose when playing Martingale strategies &#8211; in roulette or in trading. <br><br>Eventually.</p>



<p>Probably.</p>



<p>What this looks like is a smooth chart with minimum drawdown right up until the end event where everything is lost. What this means for an expert advisor developer is that they can have a fantastic, promising looking chart &#8211; even when tested in real-time, with live funds &#8211; and they can promote that using their marketing budget to get many new subscribers. </p>



<p>End event!</p>



<p>I lost my money this way once with an expert advisor&#8230; I learned to not trust backtests, not trust test accounts and only trust my own forward tests &#8211; and remember the first rule: Only invest what you can afford to lose!</p>



<p>Anyways, loads of people earned great money on forex robot trades. Many people still do. You can, too, if you have a good strategy that can&#8217;t easily be duplicated and you maintain your edge over the market. Many more will make money on Expert Advisors, or other forms of trading automation.  </p>



<p>Hooah!</p>



<h2>Robot Traders at Scale: Wall Street</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://timeentertainment.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/twows-02401r.jpg?w=720&amp;h=480&amp;crop=1" alt="Image result for wolf of wall street"/></figure>



<p>Movie theatrics and fiction aside, The Wolf of Wallstreet made all his money by manipulating IPOs that he then controlled a relatively large stake in at arm&#8217;s length. </p>



<p>How does one manipulate IPO prices? One trades. Using many accounts. One trades back and forth, and loses a bit on the fees and the spread but encourages other parties on the market to trade more and more and even influence the price &#8211; at just the right times in just the right increments &#8211; and voila, you&#8217;ve committed securities fraud but you&#8217;re mad rich!</p>



<p>In reality, most of Wall St probably aren&#8217;t committing securities fraud. Probably.</p>



<p>In reality, all of Wall St are using some form of trading automation and high-frequency trading to achieve their goals. Definitely.</p>



<p>By the time any sort of opportunity exists long enough to be traded against, 10s 1000s other parties employing your same or a very like strategy have noticed that opportunity and already traded it. In traditional markets.</p>



<p>How do you react? Be the first. Be the fastest. Poor tens millions dollars into developing faster infrastructure, faster code, and faster trades. Automation and delegation are the keys to success, no?</p>



<p>What this boils down to is that the consumer with their expert advisors and trading terminals on $500 computers instead of $500 000 supercomputers are beaten to the punch by Wall St at every turn.</p>



<p>Darn! All is lost!</p>



<p>No&#8230; Read on!</p>



<h2>Most Profitable Automated Trades: Cryptocurrency</h2>



<p>Where Wall St haven&#8217;t yet conquered the markets &#8211; even better: new markets are introduced daily &#8211; and where market discrepencies even across exchanges offer up opportunities for arbitrage (sure-bet, guaranteed profit.. look into it! Do your own research&#8230; or <a href="https://jare.cloud/2020/01/16/amazon-ebay-aliexpress-retail-arbitrage-as-a-service/">read this article I wrote, it&#8217;s about a retail arbitrage business </a>&#8211; same idea! Buy low sell high!) and the execution times and volumes of big players don&#8217;t necessarily &#8216;own&#8217; the markets?</p>



<p>Bitcoin and cryptocurrency.</p>



<p>Everyone has a fair chance in crypto to earn a dollar &#8211; even though the big boys still spend millions on their trading bots, the little guys control much more of the market share than vs Wall St and traditional markets.</p>



<p>Things like sentiment &#8211; feelings expressed on Twitter &#8211; have a massive, predictable effect on smaller-volume coins. <a href="https://jare.cloud/2020/01/15/automated-crypto-trading-bot-to-buy-pump-and-dump-sentiment-signals-from-twitter/">Read about my Twitter sentiment bot I&#8217;m presently creating here</a> (it&#8217;s fairly technical &#8211; but gives a good overview!)</p>



<p>All in all, it&#8217;s easier to make a quick buck with less capital on crypto &#8211; reliably, predictably &#8211; than it is in traditional markets.</p>



<p>You can try <a href="https://3commas.io/?c=tc174830">3commas &#8211; where you can automate your favorite strategy</a>, pull in a given strategy from places like TradingView, or subscribe to any number live automated trading strategies. For the win!</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>You, too, can earn with automation! You, too can create or hire someone to create your own trading bots &#8211; for traditional markets, or for cryptocurrencies! You, too, can feel that little joy and hit of dopamine when your trades exit in the green!</p>



<p>Go for it!</p>

<p>As I detailed in this recent article surrounding <a href="https://jare.cloud/2020/01/15/automated-crypto-trading-bot-to-buy-pump-and-dump-sentiment-signals-from-twitter/">Twitter automation to buy cryptocurrency during pumps</a> and in this way-old Hackernoon and Medium discussing how I once <a href="https://medium.com/@jarettdunn/i-1000th-idea-to-make-money-online-via-python-chained-sqlmaps-8acb25cc9ad8?source=your_stories_page---------------------------">toyed with the morality of ethical hacking for profit</a> &#8211; it&#8217;s obvious that I often have ideas for tech businesses that don&#8217;t really get off the ground. I lack the marketing chops to execute these things, so I&#8217;m going to continue letting you guys know how my Proof of Concepts go and maybe one day some of you can make a living with one of my ideas!</p>



<p>This is another entry in Insanely Marketable Business Ideas. Hooah!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/606522166166421534/667572917105590282/unknown.png" alt=""/><figcaption>Source: My code just a minute ago</figcaption></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/606522166166421534/667573207414341633/unknown.png" alt=""/><figcaption>Source: My code a minute after that</figcaption></figure>



<p>What you might notice about these two images is the insanely obvious: if someone were to buy one of these generic handhold consoles on Aliexpress and then sell it on Ebay they could pocket the difference in costs. This is called &#8216;retail arbitrage,&#8217; where retail is what we&#8217;re trading and arbitrage is the act of buying low and immediately selling high. It&#8217;s preferable to sell before you have to buy &#8211; which you can effectively do selling on these marketplaces.</p>



<p>You&#8217;ll notice that I&#8217;m lacking a corresponding Amazon screenshot &#8211; their Product Advertising API requires you to have 3 sales in a certain amount of time as an affiliate before you can have access to the API. D&#8217;oh! I&#8217;ve sent them a message saying I&#8217;m creating a shopping comparison engine &#8211; it might be unwise to say we&#8217;re propagating the arbitrage &#8216;problem.&#8217; Sometimes, people that buy an item on Ebay and receive a package wrapped up by Amazon Fulfillment will become irate they&#8217;ve been the victim of not knowing they can search more than one site, and they might kick up a customer service complaint&#8230;</p>



<p>Either way, there&#8217;s money to be made!</p>



<p>But, that&#8217;s not my idea. That idea&#8217;s been tried and done effectively by many, and you can google for more info. My idea is buried in those screenshots, above, and in my explanation of the Amazon part too &#8211; these are affiliate links. If someone were to visit Aliexpress or Ebay after clicking my link and place an order within a month or a few months, I get a little % kickback from that sale. </p>



<p>In the case of providing this as a service, the model would be that I create a beautiful and effective comparison tool to find the highest potential margins for search results or by the best possible margins in a given category and finding exact (or near-exact by text compare) title matches, then display them in easy-to-organize lists for arbitrageurs to peruse, click the links, buy a bulk order of many items or maybe just an item or two, and as I build my network &#8211; and community &#8211; of arbitrageurs, my income from the % of a % of each initial sale will exponentially increase above and beyond the potential returns from the actual arbitraging. </p>



<p>Retail arbitrage is fraught with potential pitfalls: from max. orders or max. sales, all the way to the customer service burden &#8211; and potential returns, restocking fees or concerns &#8211; it is easy to lose some or all of your profits in a second with retail arbitraging if you&#8217;re not careful. When building a service that provides instant comparisons for the potential arbitrageur &#8211; and a supportive, helpful community of arbitraging friends &#8211; we can ensure the overall success and growth of the operation.</p>



<p>Sunk costs?</p>



<p>Upkeep of servers, initial dev and MARKETING.</p>



<p>Potential upside?</p>



<p>We&#8217;d run the site for free. Everyone can come in and discuss the opportunities of Retail Arbitrage, and use the tool to their heart&#8217;s content. In return, our marketing efforts will reflect the fact that other arbitraging tools require a monthly or yearly subscription &#8211; putting ours leagues ahead of the competition.</p>



<p>Ebay Partner Network pays 1-6% per sale depending on geo, if the sale happens within 24hrs of clicking the link. Aliexpress up to 9%, and Amazon pays up to a walloping 10%! When someone wants to arbitrage again, they&#8217;d certainly want to find a new-and-improved arbitrage deal &#8211; they&#8217;d return to our platform, find a new killer deal, place another order and boombingbang more affiliate income!</p>



<p>NOW, for the win, let&#8217;s review some code.</p>



<p>First, after running npm install for the required packages, we&#8217;ll require them in the code:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>let eBay = require('ebay-node-api')
var request = require('request')</code></pre>



<p>Next we&#8217;ll instantiate our eBay object, like so:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>let ebay = new eBay({
    clientID: '',
    env: 'PRODUCTION', // optional default = 'PRODUCTION'
    headers:{ // optional
        'X-EBAY-C-MARKETPLACE-ID': 'EBAY_US' // For Great Britain https://www.ebay.co.uk/
    }
})</code></pre>



<p>Now, I found out that I could use eBay&#8217;s affiliate tools to build an affiliate URL using my account and campaign. Afterwards, I hijack the &amp;mpre= field and replace the item URL with my URL for any given item, to build a new-and-improved eBay aff link for any given URL.</p>



<p>For fun and profit, we set our eBay affiliate URL &#8216;template&#8217; as well as our hard-coded search term:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>var template = 'http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/706-53473-19255-0/1?ff3=4&amp;pub=5575480811&amp;toolid=10001&amp;campid=5338476385&amp;customid=&amp;mpre='
var search = '500in1 nes'</code></pre>



<p>In our ebaydo function, we search eBay products using the eBay node package and loop over the resulting json. The url for the item is parsed then encoded, and we create our affiliate URL by joining our template from above with this new encoded item&#8217;s url. </p>



<p>Voila! Paydirt!</p>



<p>We log to console the network, affiliate URL, title, and price object for fun and profit. If there&#8217;s an error, let&#8217;s also log the error! Debugging is fun, right?</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>function ebaydo(keywords) {

    ebay.findItemsByKeywords({
        keywords: keywords
    }).then((data) => {
        for (var item in data[0].searchResult[0].item) {
            url = encodeURIComponent(data[0].searchResult[0].item[item].viewItemURL[0])
            url = template + url
            console.log('ebay:')
            console.log('affiliate url: ' + url)
            console.log(data[0].searchResult[0].item[item].title[0])
            console.log(data[0].searchResult[0].item[item].sellingStatus[0].currentPrice[0])
            console.log(' ')
        }
    }, (error) => {
        console.log(error);
    });
}</code></pre>



<p>The ali function is more complicated. First, we&#8217;ll get and parse the current time into url-encoded string. Phew, that took a lot of Googling to figure out&#8230;</p>



<p>Next, we&#8217;ll encode our keywords. That probably means some handy %20s (spaces). Then, we load a list of products based on those keywords from Alibaba&#8217;s API, parse the result into json, loop over the products and save some useful info to vars for later. We&#8217;ll take note of the price, product url, image url (why not? Should have done this for eBay too! People can compare the images when finding their like products&#8230;) and product title. Next, we send some of these vars off to a separate function.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>function ali(keywords) {
    var time = new Date();
    var time2 = (time.getHours().toString() + "%20" + time.getMinutes().toString() + "%20" + time.getSeconds().toString());
    keywords = encodeURIComponent(keywords)

    var url = "http://gw.api.alibaba.com/openapi/param2/2/portals.open/api.listPromotionProduct/76080?sort=volumeDown&amp;fields=salePrice,productTitle,volume,imageUrl,productUrl&amp;keywords=" + keywords;
    console.log('keywords?: ' + url);
    var responses = new Array();
    try {
        var result2 = request.get(url, function(e, r, result2) {
            var json = JSON.parse(result2)
            if (json.result != null) {
                for (var i in json.result.products) {
                    console.log(json.result.products[i]);
                    var price = json.result.products[i].salePrice;
                    var id = json.result.products[i].productUrl;
                    var img = json.result.products[i].imageUrl;
                    var title = json.result.products[i].productTitle;

                    
                    dosearchurl(id, title, img, price)
                }
            } 
        })
    } catch (e) {
        console.log('exception: ' + e.toString());
    }
}
</code></pre>



<p>In dosearchurl, this genius technique allows me to have the variables persistent over the next request.get call, which returns a promise, meaning that if we did request.get inside a for loop then tried to access our old variables (like title in this case, for example) it would only find the variable value at the state in the new point in time when the promise has resolved (ie. the request completes) &#8211; meaning all our results would output the same data as the for loop has completed and it executes the console.log code with the for loops final value, instead of each incremented value.</p>



<p>So, by taking the for loop and feeding it the variables in a different scope, the variables remain persistent even though there&#8217;s a time delay for the promise &#8211; and we can output the variables in their proper sequence, instead of only the final one over and over again.</p>



<p>In here, we load the product id on another alibaba api endpoint &#8211; this one to create an affiliate url for our product we&#8217;ve found. Then, we output to console all the juicey details about our potential arbitrageur&#8217;s opportunity &#8211; and our potential affiliate income.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>function dosearchurl(id, title, img, price) {
    var url2 = "http://gw.api.alibaba.com/openapi/param2/2/portals.open/api.getPromotionLinks/76080?fields=promotionUrl&amp;trackingId=4632&amp;urls=" + id;
    var responses = new Array();
    try {
        var result3 = request.get(url2, function(e, r, result3) {

            var json = JSON.parse(result3)
            console.log('aliexpress:')
            console.log('title: ' + title.replace(/&lt;[^>]*>?/gm, ''))
            console.log('affiliate url: ' + json.result.promotionUrls[0].promotionUrl);
            console.log('img: ' + img)
            console.log('price: ' + price)
            console.log(' ')

        });

    } catch (e) {
        console.log('exception: ' + e.toString());
    }
}</code></pre>



<p>It&#8217;s a win-win-win: goldmoney for the arbitrageur who earns surebet money, paydirt for me as I gain a tiny percent of those sales over and over again, and of course it&#8217;s a good thing &#8211; big bucks &#8211; for the retail marketplace. Hooah!</p>



<p>I hope you&#8217;re as excited about my POC as I was creating it then describing it here. Someone will surely bet some time and effort and marketing chops to execute this vision.. will it be me?</p>

<p>Folks welcome to Web 3.0.</p>



<p>Not only does Brave pay me in $BAT for browsing the internet by serving me ads I enjoy watching based on my interests, it literally allows people to tip and automatically contribute to those Twitter users using Brave. </p>



<p>It also allows me to monetize my YouTube &#8211; I have 344 viewers watching my old ass YouTubes for 9.5hrs/month. I can now monetize some of thoseâ€¦</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-14-1024x410.png" alt="" class="wp-image-214" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-14-1024x410.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-14-300x120.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-14-768x308.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-14.png 1231w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Admittedly, my one true passion is finding a way to create evergreen and passive income for myself &#8211; now people viewing my YouTube videos will automagically share some of their $BAT with me. People that like me even more might opt to share more %, or even tip me one-time or repeatedly&#8230;.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve been aware of BAT as a project and Brave as a browser for a long, long time, being a crypto enthusiast all these years. I resisted doing a tiny 5-second Google search because I assumed it was a new-fangled low-functioning browser that would disappoint. I wasn&#8217;t aware it&#8217;s literally built on chrome, can import my bookmarks and I can use all my favorite extensions!</p>

<p>On top of all that, it&#8217;s actively blocking unwanted ads across sites and ad networks while also keeping my private browsing information like cookie data or personally identifiable information from being transmitted from my machine.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-16-1024x682.png" alt="" class="wp-image-216" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-16-1024x682.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-16-300x200.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-16-768x512.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-16-120x80.png 120w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-16.png 1031w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>As <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/31/personal-data-corporate-use-google-amazon">an article on theguardian quotes</a>: &#8216;Data appropriation is a form of exploitation because companies use data to create value without providing people with comparable compensation.&#8217;</p>



<p>What&#8217;s the solution? Limit the data you send! Be compensated for the data you do choose to share!</p>



<p>Within a few seconds of having the browser opened, I&#8217;d already earned a penny as they showed me an ad from BlockFi.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-17-1024x629.png" alt="" class="wp-image-217" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-17-1024x629.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-17-300x184.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-17-768x472.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-17.png 1083w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Another ad, advertising BAT&#8217;s community forums, turned out to be incredibly informative: as it turns out, the content creators signup page had more options than just Website, Twitch, YouTube. I had connected all three of these already but on the community forum I found a <a href="https://forum.batcommunity.org/t/use-twitter-to-receive-brave-rewards/5987/12">thread talking about tipping people on Twitter</a> &#8211; I thought: I must have this.</p>



<p>On further clicking I found Brave had loads more options for me to earn as a content creator! It&#8217;s probably just my desktop settings &#8211; at 175% zoom because I&#8217;m blind! </p>



<p>Also, in the interface of their Chrome-based browser, they&#8217;ve very cleverly integrated a &#8216;tip&#8217; button on Twitter tweets &#8211; right there in the UI.  </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-18-1024x663.png" alt="" class="wp-image-218" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-18-1024x663.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-18-300x194.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-18-768x497.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-18-850x550.png 850w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/image-18.png 1037w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>When I visit a content creator of any kind &#8211; including Github profiles, where I receive 100s more evergreen, passive views than I do on YouTube or even your reddit profile which might be (pardon the pun) more prolific than your Twitter &#8211; they&#8217;re automagically added to my pool of content creators that I&#8217;m going to automagically share some tokens with at the end of the month. I get to set totals, %s for each creator, and every other granular little detail.</p>



<p>Essentially, Brave gives the advertising revenue to the end-user who then chooses which publishers they want to reward with how much tokens &#8211; and they get to up the ante for those publishers they&#8217;re truly fans of. It&#8217;s a brilliant idea!</p>
